# Deploy

Use the [CLI](/cli) to deploy your contracts directly to **Any EVM compatible chain** using the [dashboard](/dashboard).

```bash
npx thirdweb deploy
```

## Usage

Running this command will:

- Detect the framework (Hardhat, Foundry or Truffle).
- **Compile** all the contracts in the current directory using your project settings.
- Allow you to select which contract(s) you want to deploy.
- Upload your contract metadata to IPFS, making sure it matches exactly the encoded IPFS hash in the compiled bytecode.
- Detect the [extensions](/solidity/extensions) on your contract.
- Open the deploy flow in the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) for you to connect a wallet, input the contract parameters
  and select a chain to deploy to, without needing to hardcode private keys!

```bash
npx thirdweb [options]
```
