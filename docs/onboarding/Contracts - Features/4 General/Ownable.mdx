# Ownable

The `Ownable` smart contract extension is usable with any base smart contract. It lets you set an owner for your smart contract.

<ViewContractCodeButton
  link="https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/extension/Ownable.sol"
  name="Ownable"
/>

## Unlocked Features

Once deployed, you can use the features made available by these contracts on the SDK and dashboard:

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 24, flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Contract Owner"
      link="/sdk/advanced-features/contract-settings#contract-owner"
      image="/assets/icons/general.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Implementing the Contract

Import the contract extension and make your contract inherit it.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/Ownable.sol";

contract MyContract is Ownable {
    /**
     *  This function returns who is authorized to set the owner of your contract.
     *
     *  As an EXAMPLE, we'll only allow the current owner to set the contract's new owner.
     *
     *  You MUST complete the body of this function to use the `Ownable` extension.
     */
    function _canSetOwner() internal virtual view override returns (bool) {
        return msg.sender == owner();
    }
}
```
