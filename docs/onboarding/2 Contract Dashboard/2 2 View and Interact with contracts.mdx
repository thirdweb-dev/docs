# View & Interact with Contracts

The **Contract Explorer** is available to all contracts deployed with thirdweb in the **Overview** tab,
and allows any user to view and call all of the functions on your smart contract from their connected wallet.

This page is accessible to anyone, meaning users can interact directly with your contract using the dashboard if they choose to do so!

Each function also comes with a **Code** snippet that shows you how to use the [Web3 SDKs](/web3-sdk) to interact with each function
of your contract in a variety of languages.

## Verifying Contracts

You can view the compiled source code of your contract, and verify it on sites like Etherscan from within the **Source** tab:
