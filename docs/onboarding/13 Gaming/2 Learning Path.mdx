We've prepared a set of resources to help you hit the ground running with our GamingKit.

Below, you'll find our recommended pathway to learning game development
with Unity and integrating blockchain-based functionality into your games.

## Unity Fundamentals

If this is your first time creating games, we strongly recommend learning the basics of
Unity, such as navigating the editor, creating objects, and scripting with C#.

### Unity Essentials

Before you begin, you'll need to download and install Unity Hub;
a tool that allows you to download and manage multiple versions of Unity on your computer.

Learn how to navigate the Unity Editor, create and manipulate objects, and
build a simple game with basic gameplay by following the [Unity Essentials Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials)
on Unity Learn.

### Programming in Unity

After familiarizing yourself with the Unity Editor, you'll want to learn how to program in Unity.

This will help you understand how to create scripts and behaviors for the items you create in the editor.

We recommend the [Junior Programmer Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer) on Unity Learn.
