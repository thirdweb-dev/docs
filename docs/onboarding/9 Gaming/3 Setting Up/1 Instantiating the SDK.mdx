# Instantiating the SDK

Initialize the [SDK](/unity/ThirdwebSDK) in read-only mode when you need to read data from the blockchain.

To write transactions to the blockchain from a wallet, you need to [connect to a wallet](/gaming/setting-up/connect-wallets) _after_
creating a read-only instance.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Thirdweb; // 1. Import the ThirdwebSDK

public class DemoClass : MonoBehaviour
{
    // 2. Create a ThirdwebSDK instance for us to use throughout the class
    private ThirdwebSDK sdk;

    void Start()
    {
        // 3. When the app starts, set up the ThirdwebSDK
        // Below, we're setting up a read-only instance on the "goerli" test network.
        sdk = new ThirdwebSDK("goerli");
    }
}
```
