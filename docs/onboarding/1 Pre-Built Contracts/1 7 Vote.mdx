The Vote contract is designed for groups such as DAOs to vote on proposals.

To use the Vote contract, you also need to have an existing ERC-20 token,
such as our [token contract](/pre-built-contracts/token) to act as the governance token.

## Use Cases & Examples

You could use the Vote contract to:

- Vote to decide on organizational changes
- Vote on managing and distributing funds in a treasury
- Vote on any other proposal in an organization, such as a DAO

## Using the Contract in the SDK

This page outlines how you can create and configure your vote contract using the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

You can also use our [Web3 SDK](/web3-sdk) to create and interact with your contract.

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 24 }}>
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ marginTop: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Using the Vote Contract in the Web3 SDK"
