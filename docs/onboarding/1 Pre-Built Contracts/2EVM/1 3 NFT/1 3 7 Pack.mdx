# Pack

<div className="deployContractBtnContainer" style={{ marginTop: -70 }}>

</div>

The pack contract lets you bundle
[ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20),
[ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and,
[ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) tokens together into **ERC1155 NFTs** that act as randomized loot boxes.
The packs are ERC1155 NFTs themselves, which can have the metadata you'd expect of an NFT,
such as a name, image, description, etc.

When a pack is opened, a pre-defined quantity of tokens are randomly selected from the ones
that were used to create the packs _(that haven't already been selected)_, and awarded to the opener.
The pack NFT is burned as it's opened.

You can configure how many tokens get selected for the pack:

- How many tokens are in each "unit" (for ERC20 & ERC1155 tokens - one unit could be multiple tokens).
- How many units are in each pack.

## Use Cases & Examples

You could use the Pack contract to:

- Create randomized NFT loot boxes
- Run a randomized raffle where some users open a winning ticket
- Reward your community with token gift boxes

and it's limitations, visit our [Pack Design Doc](/contracts/design/pack)!

## Using the Contract in the SDK

This page outlines how you can create and configure your pack contract using the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

You can also use our [SDK](/sdk) to create and interact with your contract.
