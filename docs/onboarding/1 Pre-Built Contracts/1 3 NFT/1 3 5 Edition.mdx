# Edition

<div className="deployContractBtnContainer" style={{ marginTop: -70 }}>
  <DeployThisContractButton

    contractType="edition"
  />
</div>

The **Edition** contract is best used when you want to release many NFTs based on the same asset, but you **don't** want to "drop" or "release" them for your community to claim.

Unlike the [Edition Drop](/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop) contract, the Edition contract does not **lazy mint** your NFTs. Instead, NFTs are minted immediately when they are added to the collection.

This means you can still transfer the NFTs or sell them on a [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace) and perform any other actions you would expect to do with an NFT.

## Use Cases & Examples

You could use the Edition contract to:

- Create an NFT Collection where each NFT has 100 copies
- Airdrop an NFT to a list of addresses that all use the same asset and metadata
- Create 10 "copies" of your artwork and sell them on a [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace)

## Using the Contract in the SDK

This page outlines how you can create and configure your edition drop contract using the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

You can also use our [SDK](/sdk) to create and interact with your contract.

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 24 }}>
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ marginTop: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Using the Edition Contract in the SDK"
      link="/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/edition"
      image="/assets/icons/edition.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Click **Airdrop** on the token you want to use, and upload a `.csv` file containing a list of addresses you want to airdrop NFTs to.

![Airdrop](../assets/airdrop.png)

In the `.csv` file, you must specify an `address` column and a `quantity` column, representing the address you want to send the NFTs and how many you wish to send.
You can download our example [CSV File](https://thirdweb.com/airdrop.csv) to get started.

### Contract Metadata

To configure the image, name, and description of the contract, click the **Settings** tab:
