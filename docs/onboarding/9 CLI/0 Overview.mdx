# CLI

The CLI provides tools to create, build, and deploy projects using thirdweb tools and infrastructure. Using the CLI, you can
create new projects with the SDK configured, build, publish and deploy smart contracts, generate types while developing, upload files to IPFS, and more.

## Installation

Install the CLI package globally to use the commands anywhere on your system.
