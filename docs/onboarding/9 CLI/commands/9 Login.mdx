# Login

:::caution
If you are on windows, please avoid using powershell it has some known issues that we are actively working on, please use git bash instead or the windows command prompt.
:::

Authenticate with the thirdweb CLI using your API secret key or replace an existing API secret key. You can find or create your API secret key at the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).
By using an API key, you can access the thirdweb infrastructure and services which the CLI commands use under the hood such as storage. 

```bash
npx thirdweb login [options]
```

## Usage

If it's your first time using the CLI you will need to login with your API secret key in order to use the following commands:

- [Deploy](/deploy)
- [Publish](/publish)
- [Upload](/cli/upload)
- [Generate](/cli/generate)

Once you've logged in, your API secret key will be stored in your home directory for future use.

:::info
If you want to login with a different API secret key, you can use the `--new` flag to replace your existing API secret key.
:::

```bash
npx thirdweb login --new <api-secret-key>
```
