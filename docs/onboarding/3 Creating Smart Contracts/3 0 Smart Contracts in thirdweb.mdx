# Smart Contracts Overview

<div className="heroGrid">

<div>

Smart contracts are pieces of code that are stored and run on the blockchain.

We offer two ways to build and deploy smart contracts:

1. [Pre-built contracts](/smart-contracts/deploying-pre-built-contracts) that are ready to deploy via the SDK or the dashboard.
2. Custom contracts that you can build with our [Solidity SDK](/thirdweb-deploy/contract-extensions) and ship with [thirdweb deploy](/thirdweb-deploy).

Both methods unlock features from our dashboard and SDK that help you develop web3 applications that interact with your smart contract.
