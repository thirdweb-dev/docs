# Quick Start

Learn how to build a smart contract using contract extensions and deploy it using thirdweb deploy.

## Creating a Solidity Project

Run the `npx hardhat` command to create a basic project with a smart contract using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

```bash
npx hardhat
```

Select "Create a sample project" from the menu to get started.

![npx hardhat](./assets/npx-hardhat.png)

:::info Project Dependencies

Hardhat will ask you to install a list of packages at this point, you can do this by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev "hardhat@^2.6.8" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle@^2.0.0" "ethereum-waffle@^3.0.0" "chai@^4.2.0" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@^2.0.0" "ethers@^5.0.0"
```

:::

Now we have a simple project with a `Greeter` smart contract, let's introduce our Solidity SDK!

## Installing the SDK

To use the SDK, install the [@thirdweb-dev/contracts package](/contracts).

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/contracts
```

## Implementing a contract extension

Open the project in your text editor, and remove the existing contents of the `Greeter.sol` file.

We'll be creating our own custom ERC-721 NFT contract in this file.

Let's first import the [IMintableERC721](/thirdweb-deploy/contract-extensions/erc721#erc721mintable) contract extension.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/feature/interface/IMintableERC721.sol";
```

Next, we need our contract to implement this interface, by saying our contract `is` the `IMintableERC721` interface.

```solidity
// Here, we tell Solidity that our Awesome NFT contract implements the IMintableERC721 interface.
contract MyAwesomeNft is IMintableERC721 {

}
```

:::tip Viewing the source code

If you're using VS Code, you can `Ctrl / ⌘ + click` on `IMintableERC721` to see the functions that must be implemented to satisfy the interface!
In the gif below, you can see we need to implement the `mintTo` function.

![clickinto](./assets/clickinto.gif)

:::

We now need to implement the `mintTo` function from the `IMintableERC721` interface.
You have total freedom over how you choose to implement this function in your contract, but let's explore an example of how you might implement it.

## Writing contract functions

For our contract, we'll implement [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721)'s `ERC721URIStorage` interface
that allows us to have NFTs with metadata, and also utilize the [Counter](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/utils#Counters) utility to keep track of our token IDs.

To install these, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

Next, we'll tell Solidity that our contract is both an `ERC721URIStorage` _and_ an `IMintableERC721` contract.

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/feature/interface/IMintableERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

// Now our contract implements both the ERC721URIStorage and IMintableERC721 interfaces.
contract MyAwesomeNft is ERC721URIStorage, IMintableERC721 {

}
```

To initialize a `Counter` that starts from `0` to represent our token IDs, we can use the following code:

```solidity
contract MyAwesomeNft is ERC721URIStorage, IMintableERC721, IERC721Supply {
    // Create a new counter to represent the token ID that we can safely increment.
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;

    // This sets the name and symbol of our NFT contract when it is created.
    constructor() ERC721("Awesome NFTs", "AWSM") {}
}
```

Now let's use the functionality provided to us from the `ERC721URIStorage` interface to write our `mintTo` function.

:::tip Function Signature

In VS Code, you can view the function signature from the `IMintableERC721` file by `Ctrl / ⌘ + click`ing on `IMintableERC721`,
pasting the `mintTo` function into our contract, and signifying we are going to `override` it.

![function signature](./assets/function-signature.gif)

:::

Now all that's left to do is write the `mint` logic inside this function:

```solidity
function mintTo(address to, string calldata uri) external override returns (uint256) {
    // Get the next token ID from the counter.
    uint256 newTokenId = _tokenIds.current();

    // Mint the token and set the metadata
    _mint(to, newTokenId);
    _setTokenURI(newTokenId, uri);

    // Increment the counter for next time.
    _tokenIds.increment();

    // Emit an event that the token was minted (enables listening to live events in the SDK).
    emit TokensMinted(to, newTokenId, uri);

    return newTokenId;
}
```

You just created your very own ERC-721 NFT Collection contract!

Let's see what we can do with it!

## Detecting contract extensions

The thirdweb CLI provides a command to detect the implemented contract extensions.

```bash
npx thirdweb detect
```

This command:

- Compiles your contract
- Detects the extensions you have successfully implemented
- Shows you other extensions you might want to implement _(spoilers)_!

![npx thirdweb detect](./assets/thirdweb-detect.png)

As you can see, we have successfully implemented the `ERC721` and `ERC721Mintable` contract extensions in our contract.

Now let's go ahead and deploy it!

## Deploying contracts

Run the following command to deploy your contract:

```bash
npx thirdweb deploy
```

This command:

- Detects any contract(s) in your project
- Compiles them
- Uploads the contract ABIs and bytecode to IPFS
- Generates a deploy link for you to deploy the contract onto the blockchain - no private keys required!

![npx thirdweb deploy](./assets/deploy.png)

Open the link in your browser, and you'll be taken to the thirdweb dashboard where you can deploy your contract.

![thirdweb dashboard](./assets/dashboard.png)

Select the network you want to deploy to, and click `Deploy`.

Once deployed, you'll have your very own contract dashboard where you can view and **execute** all of the available functions on your contract.

![contract dashboard](./assets/deployed-state.png)

From here, you can easily view, `mint`, and `transfer`, tokens from your contract!

If you select the `NFTs` tab from the menu, you will notice we can't yet view all of the NFTs minted in our contract,
because we didn't implement an `Enumerable` contract extension, such as [IERC721Supply](/thirdweb-deploy/contract-extensions/erc721#erc721enumerable)

![nfts tab](./assets/no-enum.png)

Let's quickly go back to our contract and implement an `Enumerable` contract extension.

## Unlocking thirdweb features

Let's go through the same process again, to demonstrate the general flow of adding contract extensions to your contract.

**Import the contract extension**

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/eip/interface/IERC721Supply.sol";
```

**Implement the interface**

```solidity
// Now we also implement the IERC721Supply interface.
contract MyAwesomeNft is ERC721URIStorage, IMintableERC721, IERC721Supply {
```

**Implement the required functions from the interface**

```solidity
function totalSupply() external view override returns (uint256) {
    return _tokenIds.current();
}
```

**Detect Contract Extensions**

```bash
npx thirdweb detect
```

Now we also have successfully implemented the `ERC721Supply` contract extension.

![npx thirdweb detect](./assets/new-interface-implement.png)

**Deploy the Contract**

```bash
npx thirdweb deploy
```

Now let's take another look at our dashboard's `NFTs` tab.

We have now enabled the following capabilities in both the SDK and the dashboard:

- View of all the NFTs in our contract
- The ability to **mint** new NFTs from the dashboard

![nfts tab](./assets/nfts-tab.png)

Let's go ahead and mint an NFT by clicking the **Mint** button on the dashboard.

<div align='center'>

![mint form](./assets/mint-form.png)

</div>

When we mint an NFT using the dashboard or the SDK on this contract, we get to utilize all of the special features that thirdweb enables, including:

- Automatic uploading and [pinning](/guides/securing-pinning-your-nft-with-ipfs#what-is-pinning) of metadata to IPFS
- Detection of contract events (such as `TokensMinted`)
- Live updating admin view of the contract

After the `mintTo` transaction is confirmed, you can view all of the NFTs that have been minted on the dashboard:

![minted nfts](./assets/minted-nfts.png)

Within the [SDK](/building-web3-apps/setting-up-the-sdk), you can also easily utilize these features, for example:

```javascript
// Minting an NFT (includes uploading metadata to IPFS automatically)
const contract = await sdk.getContract("{{contract_address}}");
await contract.nft.mint.to(walletAddress, nftMetadata);

// Viewing all NFTs (automatically resolves the metadata from IPFS for you)
const nfts = await contract.nft.query.all();
```
