# ERC721 Standard Functionality

Using ERC721 features lets you add standard ERC721 compliant NFTfunctionality to your contracts. These interfaces can give your contract simple read-only functionality as well as more complex features like NFT minting and transfers.

We support a number of different ERC721 features on your contracts that enable different SDK and dashboard functionality. Let's explore all the options below!

## ERC721

The most standard ERC721 interface, which is often considered the default and is implemented by most ERC721 tokens, is the [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) standard.

If your contract, implements all the functions in this standard, you will get support for all of the following functions in the SDK.

<strong>Setup</strong>

You can get an initial instance for your contract with the following code:

<FeatureCodeSnippets featureName="ERC721" />

## Extensions

In addition to the standard ERC721 interface, we also support the following additional ERC721 features which you can add onto your contract ERC721 contract.

:::info
In order to use these features, the contract must also implement the standard ERC721 interface as well.

### ERC721Mintable

The ERC721Mintable interface enables you to add minting functionality to your NFTs. You can add this interface to your contract by implementing all of the functions in the [IMintableER721](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/IMintableERC721) interface as shown below:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/feature/interface/IMintableERC721.sol";

// We add the interface to the contract
contract MyCustomContract is IMintableERC721 {

    // Implement functions here
    function mintTo(address to, string calldata uri) external override returns (uint256) {

    }
}
```

If your contract, implements all the functions in this standard, you will get support for the following functions in the SDK.

<strong>Setup</strong>

<FeatureCodeSnippets featureName="ERC721Mintable" />

### ERC721BatchMintable

The ERC721BatchMintable interface enables you to add batch minting functionality to your tokens. You can add this interface to your contract by implementing all of the functions in the [IMintableERC721](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/IMintableERC721) and [IMulticall](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/IMulticall) interfaces as shown below:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/feature/interface/IMintableERC721.sol";
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/feature/interface/IMulticall.sol";

// We add the interface to the contract
contract MyCustomContract is IMintableERC721, IMulticall {

    // Implement your functions below
    function mintTo(address to, string calldata uri) external override returns (uint256) {

    }

    function multicall(bytes[] data) external override returns (bytes[] results) {
       // you can use any standard multi call implementation here
    }
}
```

If your contract, implements all the functions in this standard, you will get support for the following functions in the SDK.

<strong>Setup</strong>

<FeatureCodeSnippets featureName="ERC721BatchMintable" />

### ERC721Supply

The ERC721Supply interface enables you to add NFT supply functionality to your NFTs. You can add this interface to your contract by implementing all of the functions in the [IERC721Supply](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/IERC721Supply) interface as shown below:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

// We add the interface to the contract
contract MyCustomContract {

  // Implement your function below
  function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256) {

  }
}
```

If your contract implements all the functions in this standard, you will get support for the following SDK interface.

<FeatureCodeSnippets featureName="ERC721Supply" />

### ERC721Enumerable

The ERC721Enumerable interface enables you to add enumerable functionality to your NFTs. You can add this interface to your contract by implementing all of the functions in the [IERC721Enumerable](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/IERC721Enumerable) interface as shown below:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

// We add the interface to the contract
contract MyCustomContract {

  // Implement your functions below
  function tokenByIndex(uint256 _index) external view returns (uint256) {

  }

  function tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address _owner, uint256 _index) external view returns (uint256) {

  }
}
```

If your contract implements all the functions in this standard, you will get support for the following SDK interface.

<FeatureCodeSnippets featureName="ERC721Enumerable" />
