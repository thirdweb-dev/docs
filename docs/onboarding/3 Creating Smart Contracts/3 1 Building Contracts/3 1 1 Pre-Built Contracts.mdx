# Pre-Built Contracts Overview

Pre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts, such as:

<div className="row" style={{marginBottom:24}}>

<div className="col col--4" style={{ marginTop: 8 }}>
  <QuickstartCard
    name="Releasing an NFT Drop"
    link="/getting-started/deploying-contracts"
    image="/assets/icons/drop.svg"
  />
</div>

<div className="col col--4" style={{ marginTop: 8 }}>
  <QuickstartCard
    name="Creating your own Token"
    link="/guides/create-your-currency-with-typescript-sdk"
    image="/assets/icons/token.svg"
  />
</div>

<div className="col col--4" style={{ marginTop: 8 }}>
  <QuickstartCard
    name="Building an NFT Marketplace"
    link="/guides/nft-marketplace-with-typescript-next"
    image="/assets/icons/marketplace.svg"
  />
</div>

</div>

Our pre-built contracts are:

- [Open source](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts) and free to deploy (excl. gas fees)
- [Audited](https://gateway.thirdweb.dev/ipfs/QmWfueeKQrggrVQNjWkF4sYJECp56vNnuAXCPVecFFKz2j) and supported by our [bug bounty program](https://thirdweb.notion.site/thirdweb-Bug-Bounty-Program-f78d1db776ab4f0e974c9da176fcf706)
- Fully owned by the contract deployer _(you)_
- 10x cheaper to deploy than traditional contracts

Each of them utilise the same [conract extensions](/advanced-features/contract-extensions) that are available in our Solidity SDK,
enabling you to pick and choose which features you want to include when building your own contracts. All of them come with a standard set of features that enable fine-grained control over the contract's behavior.

- [Permission control](/advanced-features/permission-controls)
- [Contract metadata](/advanced-features/contract-settings#contract-metadata)
- [Royalties and platform fees](/advanced-features/contract-settings#royalty-fees)

## How Pre-Built Contracts Work

Pre-built contracts you deploy with thirdweb are "proxy" contracts, which reduce the gas cost of deploying smart contracts by **~90%** for you.

This works by having our smart contracts run the underlying logic, and you only deploy the code that is unique to your contract.
This is possible since all of the contracts deployed using our pre-built contracts run the same logic for things
like minting, transferring, and burning tokens.

For _example_, your contract stores knowledge of its metadata and state, such as its name, and what NFTs have been minted so far.
For any logic (such as minting an NFT), it delegates this to our underlying smart contract to handle.
