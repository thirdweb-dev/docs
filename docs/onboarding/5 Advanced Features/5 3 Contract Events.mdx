# Contract Events

You can listen to events that are emitted by a contract.

This is useful when you want real-time updates of events happening on the blockchain.

The names of the events are the same as the events emitted from the smart contract.

For [pre-built contracts](/pre-built-contracts), you can inspect the [source code](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/tree/main/contracts) to see the events that are emitted in each function call.

Below are some examples:

| Event Name    | Description                                          | Source Code                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TokensClaimed | Token claimed by a wallet from a Drop contract       | [Smart Contract Code](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/079789c384307c2f9d09ee6ec61fa011a10a4028/contracts/drop/DropERC721.sol#L381)         |
| TokensMinted  | Token minted by a wallet into a NFT / Token contract | [Smart Contract Code](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/079789c384307c2f9d09ee6ec61fa011a10a4028/contracts/token/TokenERC20.sol#L244)        |
| ListingAdded  | New listing created in a marketplace contract        | [Smart Contract Code](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/feea9148b15b8bdb09cf8c91b212cef9b29e6d44/contracts/marketplace/Marketplace.sol#L265) |
