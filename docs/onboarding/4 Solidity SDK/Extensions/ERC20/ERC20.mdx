## Usage

This is an example smart contract demonstrating how to use this extension.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/eip/interface/IERC20.sol";

contract Contract is IERC20 {
    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol
    ) {}
    
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256) {
      // Your custom implementation here
    }

    function balanceOf(address who) external view returns (uint256) {
      // Your custom implementation here
    }

    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256) {
      // Your custom implementation here
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool) {
      // Your custom implementation here
    }

    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool) {
      // Your custom implementation here
    }

    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) external returns (bool); {
      // Your custom implementation here
    }
