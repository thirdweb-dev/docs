Auth can be integrated into [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) apps to enable wallet-based login. We'll go over the necessary setup below.

:::tip

You can explore a working example here:

<div className="col col--6">
  <QuickstartCard

</div>

## Installation

First, we need to install the `@thirdweb-dev/auth` package as follows:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/auth
```

## Setup

We need to setup an admin private key used to secure our authentication. We can do this by creating a new `.env.local` file at the top level of the project and adding a private key to the file:

```
ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here
```

:::warning Private Key Best Practices

It is not secure to store your private key in an environment variable.

:::

Next, we'll want to setup the Auth endpoints to enable users to login and logout with their wallet.

We can setup all the necessary endpoints by creating a `/pages/api/auth/[...thirdweb].js` file:

```javascript file=/pages/api/auth/[...thirdweb].js
import { ThirdwebAuth } from "@thirdweb-dev/auth/next";

export const { ThirdwebAuthHandler, getUser } = ThirdwebAuth({
  // Configure Auth with your private key
  privateKey: process.env.ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY || "",
  // Add in the domain of your app
  domain: "localhost:3000",
});

// Export the handler to setup all your endpoints
export default ThirdwebAuthHandler();
```

Here, we configure Auth with the `ThirdwebAuth` function, passing in our private key and domain (used to prevent phishing attacks). 

:::info

Importantly, the `domain` value here must match the `domain` that we use on the frontend when calling the `login` function.

:::

This is all it takes to setup Auth for your Next.js backends. Now let's take a look at what you can do with this.

## Usage

Once we setup Auth, we get two functions:

### ThirdwebAuthHandler

The `ThirdwebAuthHandler` functions automatically handles all the necessary API endpoints needed for Auth, and should be exported from the `/api/auth/[...thirdweb].js` file.

More specifically, by exporting the handler we'll get the following API endpoints:

**GET - `/api/auth/login`** - Sets a JWT token for the user, allowing them to login with their wallet

**GET - `/api/auth/user`** - Gets the address of the user making a request (by accessing their JWT token)

**GET - `/api/auth/logout`** - Destroys the JWT token, logging out the user

### getUser

The `getUser` function lets you get the user data of the authenticated user making a request to any other endpoint you may want to setup, including their `address`. You can use it in another endpoint as follows:

```javascript
// Import getUser from wherever you created the config
import { getUser } from "/pages/api/auth/[...thirdweb]";

const handler = async (req, res) => {
  // Get the authenticated user from the request
  const user = await getUser(req);

  // If the user is not authenticated, user will be null
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(401).json({
      message: "Not authorized.",
    })
  }

  // Otherwise, user.address will be set
  return res.status(200).json({
    address: user.address
  });
}

export default handler;
```

## Frontend

Now that our backend setup, we can easily setup our React frontend (automatically included in Next.js) with a few hooks and buttons to enable login and logout.

First, we'll need to install the `@thirdweb-dev/react` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/react
```

Now, in the `_app.js` file, we'll need to wrap our app with the `ThirdwebProvider` and provide some configuration for Auth:

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      desiredChainId={1} 
      authConfig={{
        domain: "localhost:3000",
        authUrl: "/api/auth",
      }}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

Here, we specify in the `authConfig` that our Auth backend is setup at the `/api/auth` URL, and that the domain we expect (which must match the domain we selected on the backend) is `localhost:3000`.

### Login Button

Now, we can use the `ConnectWallet` button to enable a simple login flow for our users:

```jsx
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <ConnectWallet />
  )
}

export default Home;
```

This button will allow user to connect their wallet via MetaMask, WalletConnect, and CoinbaseWallet, and then login to the backend with Auth.

### Hooks

Alternatively, we can use the `useLogin`, `useUser`, and `useLogout` hooks to enable Auth functionality in the rest of our app.

For example, I can create the following component to allow users to login, logout, and view their address:

```jsx
import { useAddress, useUser, useLogin, useLogout, useMetamask } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';

const Home = () => {
  const address = useAddress();
  const connect = useMetamask();

  const login = useLogin();
  const logout = useLogout();
  const { user } = useUser();

  return (
    <div>
      {address ? (
        <>
          <button onClick={() => login()}>Login with Wallet</button>
          <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
          <pre>User: {JSON.stringify(user || null)}</pre>
        </>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={connect}>Connect Wallet</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

Here, we use the `useLogin`, `useUser`, and `useLogout` to enable a secure wallet based login flow for users on our frontend.
