This page will help you get started with Auth using the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) framework.

:::tip

If you want to interact with a working version of the Auth + Express integration that we'll be building in this guide, you can checkout the following GitHub repository, or clone it with the command below:

```
npx thirdweb create app --template thirdweb-auth-express
```

## Getting Started

To add support for Auth to your Express.js backend, you'll need to install the `@thirdweb-dev/auth` package as well as its peer dependencies (as well as any other packages you'll need for your [wallet configuration](/auth/wallet-configuration), we'll need the `ethers` package for this example as we'll be using the `PrivateKeyWallet`):

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/auth cookie-parser ethers@5
```

Now we can setup our Express.js server by using the `@thirdweb-dev/auth/express` entrypoint. First, we need to setup our [Auth API](/auth/how-auth-works/auth-api) by adding the auth router to our app:

```ts file="src/index.ts"
import { ThirdwebAuth } from "@thirdweb-dev/auth/express";
import { PrivateKeyWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/auth/evm";
import express from "express";

const PORT = 8000;
const app = express();

const { authRouter, authMiddleware, getUser } = ThirdwebAuth({
  domain: process.env.THIRDWEB_AUTH_DOMAIN || "",
  wallet: new PrivateKeyWallet(process.env.THIRDWEB_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY || ""),
});

// Add the auth router to our app to set up the /auth/* endpoints
app.use("/auth", authRouter);

// Add the auth middleware to the rest of our app to allow user authentication on other endpoints
app.use(authMiddleware);

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Here, we first configure our `ThirdwebAuth` instance with the `domain` of our app used for anti-phishing, as well as the admin wallet used to issue and verify JWTs. In this case, we use the `PrivateKeyWallet` from the `@thirdweb-dev/auth/evm` entrypoint, but there are a number of other supported wallet setups, which you can learn more about on the wallet configuration page:

<div>
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ padding: 8, marginBottom: 12 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Wallet Configuration"
      link="/auth/wallet-configuration"
      image="/assets/icons/edition.png"
      description="Learn more about how to configure your wallet for Auth."
    />
  </div>
</div>

Finally, we add the `authRouter` to our app with the `app.use("/auth", authRouter)` line to set up all the `/auth/*` endpoints automatically. We'll also need to add the `authMiddleware` to any routes that we want to protect with Auth.

## Usage

### Authenticating the user on other routes

The `getUser` function can be used to authenticate the user on the server. It will return the user's address if the user is authenticated, or `null` if the user is not authenticated. It can be used in any API route that uses the `authMiddleware`:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
// Add the auth middleware to any routes where you want to use the getUser function
app.get("/secret", authMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  const user = await getUser(req);

  if (!user) {
    return res.status(401).json({
      message: "Not authorized.",
    });
  }

  return res.status(200).json({
    message: "This is a secret... don't tell anyone.",
  });
});
```

Alternatively, you can add the `authMiddleware` to the entire app if you want to use the `getUser` function across multiple routes.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
// Now getUser function will be available on all routes
app.use(authMiddleware);

app.get("/secret", async (req, res) => {
  const user = await getUser(req);

  if (!user) {
    return res.status(401).json({
      message: "Not authorized.",
    });
  }

  return res.status(200).json({
    message: "This is a secret... don't tell anyone.",
  });
});
```

### Validating the login request

By default, the Auth API will validate the login request by checking that the user requesting to login succesfully signed a valid [sign-in with wallet](/auth/how-auth-works/sign-in-with-wallet) message. However, this doesn't perform specific checks on the exact contents of the payload, aside from the domain used for anti-phishing.

If you want to add specific checks to enforce the exact data on the login payload signed by users, you can use the `authOptions` configuration:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
const { authRouter, authMiddleware, getUser } = ThirdwebAuth({
  ... // other config
  authOptions: {
    // Enforce that the user's login message has these exact values
    statement: "I agree to the terms of service",
    uri: "https://frontend.example.com",
    resources: ["https://terms-of-service.example.com"],
    version: "1",
    chainId: "1",
  },
});
```

Note that when you enforce these checks on the server-side, you'll also want to pass in the proper parameters to the `login` function on your client-side application to ensure that the login payload gets the correct format. You can see an [example of how to do this in the React section](/auth/client-frameworks/react#customizing-the-login-message).

**Prevent replay attacks**

Since the sign-in with wallet payload is used to login to your server, it's important to prevent third parties from being able to reuse old login payloads to falsely authenticate as other users. This reuse of old login payloads is called a replay attack.

Luckily, all sign-in with wallet payloads include a `nonce` field which is a random string generated when the request was created. If you are using a database, or have somewhere to store nonces, you can ensure that each nonce is only used once:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
const { authRouter, authMiddleware, getUser } = ThirdwebAuth({
  ... // other config
  authOptions: {
    validateNonce: async (nonce: string) => {
      // Check in database or storage if nonce exists
      const nonceExists = await dbExample.nonceExists(nonce);
      if (nonceExists) {
        throw new Error("Nonce has already been used!");
      }

      // Otherwise save nonce in database or storage for later validation
      await dbExample.saveNonce(nonce);
    }
  },
});
```

### Changing the token validity duration

By default, the JWTs issued by the server are valid for 5 hours (21600 seconds), after which the user will have to login again. If you want to change this duration, you can use the `authOptions.tokenDurationInSeconds` configuration:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
const { authRouter, authMiddleware, getUser } = ThirdwebAuth({
  ... // other config
  authOptions: {
    tokenDurationInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 1 week
  },
});
```

### Customizing cookie settings

The Auth API will set a cookie on the user's browser with the issued JWT token (learn more about cookie settings from the [Mozilla cookie reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#define_where_cookies_are_sent)). This cookie is set to be `httpOnly` and `secure` (only sent over HTTPS), which is necessary for security purposes - and is also set to use the `domain` of your API, with a `path` of `/`, and `SameSite=None`.

If you want to overwrite these, settings, you can with the `cookieOptions` configuration. For example, you may want to set your domain to be less specific - like if you have your api on `api.example.com` and a client on `client.example.com`, you may want to set your domain to `.example.com`, or you want want to set your `SameSite` setting to `strict` if your API and client are on the same domain:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
const { authRouter, authMiddleware, getUser } = ThirdwebAuth({
  ... // other config
  cookieOptions: {
    domain: ".example.com",
    path: "/api",
    sameSite: "strict" // or "lax" or "none"
  },
});
```

### Saving users in your database

We can use the `callbacks.onLogin` function to remember users in a database whenever they login, enabling a traditional database enabled authentication flow:

```ts title="pages/api/auth/[...thirdweb].ts"
export const { authRouter, authMiddleware, getUser } = ThirdwebAuth({
  ... // other config
  callbacks: {
    onLogin: async (user: User) => {
      // Create a new user entry if the user doesn't exist
      if (!await dbExample.userExists(user.address)) {
        await dbExample.createUser({ address: user.address });
      }
    },
  }
});
```

### Enhancing session data

When the server issues a JWT, the default JWT claims are added to the token (as elaborated in the [how auth works section](/auth/how-auth-works/json-web-tokens)). However, you may want to add additional data to the JWT claims to serve as session data that will persist on the token, such as certain user level permissions or access information. You can do this by returning data from the `callbacks.onLogin` callback function which treats your return value as session data to store onto the JWT.

```ts title="pages/api/auth/[...thirdweb].ts"
export const { authRouter, authMiddleware, getUser } = ThirdwebAuth({
  ... // other config
  callbacks: {
    onLogin: async (address: string) => {
      // You can populate data from your database or other sources
      const role = await dbExample.getUserRole(address);

      // Add arbitrary session data
      const session = {
        permissions: ["admin", role],
      };

      return session;
    },
  }
});
```

### Enhancing user data

Alternatively, you can populate data about a user everytime user data is requested from the `/user` endpoint or `getUser` function. This data is not session-wide as it is not stored on the JWT, so it isn't persisted an can change between requests. It can be useful for populating data that is not stored on the JWT, such as user profile information. We can do this by returning data from the `callbacks.onUser` callback function.

```ts title="pages/api/auth/[...thirdweb].ts"
import type { User } from "@thirdweb/auth/express";

export const { authRouter, authMiddleware, getUser } = ThirdwebAuth({
  ... // other config
  callbacks: {
    onUser: async (user: User) => {
      // You can populate data from your database or other sources
      const data = await dbExample.getUserData(user.address);

      return data;
    },
  }
});
```
