Once you've setup an Auth API for your application, you can use the `@thirdweb-dev/react` and `@thirdweb-dev/auth` packages to add Auth support to your React apps.

## Getting Started

To add support for Auth to your React apps, you'll first need to install the following packages:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk @thirdweb-dev/auth
```

Now we'll need to wrap our app with the `ThirdwebProvider` which stores the necessary context for Auth, and we'll provide some configuration with the `authConfig` option so that our frontend knows how to communicate with our Auth API.

```tsx title="_app.tsx"
import { ThirdwebProvider, ChainId } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      // Required configuration for the provider, but doesn't affect Auth.
      desiredChainId={ChainId.Mainnet}
      authConfig={{
        // Set this to your domain to prevent phishing attacks
        domain: "example.com",
        // The URL of your Auth API
        authUrl: "/api/auth",
      }}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

### Connect wallet & login button

The simplest way to add an Auth flow to our app is to use the `ConnectWallet` button. This button detects the `authConfig` on our `ThirdwebProvider` and will automatically prompt the user to connect their wallet with MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or WalletConnect, and then login to our app with Auth.

```tsx title="pages/index.tsx"
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  return <ConnectWallet />;
}
```

### Connect wallet & auth hooks

For a more customized setup with custom UI or logic, we can instead use the wallet connection and Auth hooks provided by the `@thirdweb-dev/react` package.

```tsx title="pages/index.tsx"
import {
  useAddress,
  useMetamask,
  useLogin,
  useLogout,
  useUser,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  const address = useAddress();
  const connect = useMetamask();
  const { login } = useLogin();
  const { logout } = useLogout();
  const { user, isLoggedIn } = useUser();

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? (
        <button onClick={() => logout()}>Logout</button>
      ) : address ? (
        <button onClick={() => login()}>Login</button>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => connect()}>Connect</button>
      )}

      <pre>Connected Wallet: {address}</pre>
      <pre>User: {user?.address || "N/A"}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here, we use the `useMetaMask` hook to prompt our users to connect their metamask wallets, and then we use the `useLogin` hook to login to our app with Auth. Then, we can access and display the logged in user with the `useUser` hook, and we can logout the user with the `useLogout` hook.

For a full list of wallet connection hooks, check out our [React SDK documentation](/react).

## Usage

### Check if a user is logged in

On the frontend, you may want to check whether or not the user is logged in to conditionally render certain parts of your app. You can do this with the `isLoggedIn` value from the `useUser` hook:

```tsx
import { isLoggedIn } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { isLoggedIn } = useUser();

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? (
        <p>Here's some content only visible to logged in users.</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Here's some content only visible to logged out users.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Accessing user & session data

Once a user is logged in, you can access their user data and session data with the `useUser` hook. The `user` value will be `null` if the user is not logged in, but once they're logged in, it will contain the `address` of the logged in user, the session `context` set by the backend on login, and any extra user-associated `data` sent by the backend.

```tsx
import { useUser } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { user } = useUser();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Logged in user: {user?.address}</p>
      <p>Session context: {user?.context}</p>
      <p>Extra user data: {user?.data}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can think of `user.context` as a way for the backend to store arbitrary session data on the JWT, like a user's role or permissions. This data is then accessible on the frontend and doesn't change until a user has to login again.

Meanwhile, `user.data` is a way for the backend to send the client any data associated with the current user like their name, profile picture, and other information. Since this data isn't stored on the JWT, it can change at any time.

### Using loading states

When using the `useUser` hook, you may want to show a loading state while the user's session is being fetched from the backend. You can do this by checking the `isLoading` value from the hook:

```tsx
import { useUser } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { user, isLoading } = useUser();

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? <p>Loading...</p> : <p>Logged in user: {user?.address}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Similarly, the `useLogin` and `useLogout` hooks also have loading states to indicate when a request to the backend is being made.

```tsx
import { useLogin, useLogout } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { login, isLoading: isLoggingIn } = useLogin();
  const { logout, isLoading: isLoggingOut } = useLogout();

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggingIn ? (
        <p>Logging in...</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => login()}>Login</button>
      )}
      {isLoggingOut ? (
        <p>Logging out...</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => logout()}>Logout</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Customizing the login message

The `login` function automatically uses some default values for the necessary fields of the [EIP4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361)/[CAIP122](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-122.md) specifications.

However, if you want full access to customize these field values, you can overwrite them by passing an object to the `login` function:

```tsx
import { useLogin } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { login } = useLogin();

  async function handleLogin() {
    // All of these fields are optional
    login({
      uri: "https://example.com",
      statement: "Please agree to our terms of service!",
      chainId: "123",
      nonce: "123"
      version: "1",
      resources: ["https://tos.example.com"],
    })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Handling errors on login

Since logging in requires the user to sign a message, the `login` fuction is asynchronous and may throw an error if the user rejects the message. You can handle this error case by using a `try/catch` block:

```tsx
import { useLogin } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { login } = useLogin();

  async function handleLogin() {
    try {
      await login();
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Cross-origin requests & cookies

Auth uses cookies to securely store JWTs in the browser context. This means that if our Auth backend and frontend aren't on the same domain, we may run into [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) issues.

Specifically, on the frontend you don't have access to cookies but they need to get sent to the backend in order for your users to authenticate to your API. This is solved because the browser automatically sends cookies on requests to your backend if your frontend and backend are on the same URL.

When your frontend and backend are on different domains, you may need to manually specify that your request should include cookies by setting the `credentials` option in your request to `include`:

```ts
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch("/api/data", {
    // Include all cookies in this request
    credentials: "include",
  });
  const data = await res.json();
}
```
