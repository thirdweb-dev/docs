# Auth

import QuickstartCard from "@components/QuickstartCard";

Auth is a developer SDK that allows for integration of passwordless web3-native authentication and authorization into your applications.

It enables users to sign-in with their wallets, allowing apps to access rich blockchain-level data and interact with their users on-chain.

With Auth, developers can build applications that have secure, self-custodied, web3-first authentication.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/auth
```

## Applications

Auth unlocks a variety of new possibilities by enabling the connection of web2 and web3 flows. Add wallet-based authentication to existing applications or build web3 experiences that utilize server-side architecture.

Below are some of the applications that Auth enables:

- **Passwordless Authentication:** Let users seamlessly login to your applications with just their wallets.
- **Identity Verification:** Securely verify the on-chain identities of existing users.
- **Gated Resources:** Gate access to protected resources based on on-chain criteria like NFT ownership.
- **On-chain Interaction:** Interact with users on-chain, like sending users reward NFTs.
- **On-chain Payments:** Allow users to pay for your services with on-chain assets like ETH or ERC20 tokens.
- **Access On-chain Data:** Access rich on-chain data associated with your users.
