import ThirdwebCodeSnippet from "../../../src/components/ThirdwebCodeSnippet";

For more advanced and specific use-cases, we provide a complete Auth SDK available within the `ThirdwebSDK`. The Auth SDK has functions that enable you to:

- Prompt users to sign the necessary [Sign-in with Ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) message used for auth
- Verify a user's wallet address on the server
- Generate a JWT authentication token for the verified user
- Check the validity of a previously generated JWT token

### Making a Login Request

This function allows the connected user to sign a [Sign-in with Ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) compliant message and generate a payload that can be sent to the server.


:::tip

In most cases, you'll want to use the React SDK or JavaScript SDK for this if you want to allow users to login from a frontend application. However, for scripting or backend-to-backend use cases, you can also use the Python or Go SDKs.

:::

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract="WalletAuthenticator" name="login" />

### Verifying the User Address

This function lets you securely extract the wallet address of the client-side user from a `payload` generated by the `login` function.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract="WalletAuthenticator" name="verify" languages={{ react: false }} groupId="thirdweb-code-snippet-no-react" />

### Generating a JWT

Alternatively, the backend can use the `payload` from the `login` function to generated a JWT authentication token for the user with the following method:

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract="WalletAuthenticator" name="generateAuthToken" languages={{ react: false }} groupId="thirdweb-code-snippet-no-react" />

This token contains data around how long the login request is valid, the address of the user that logged in, and the domain that the token is inteded for - all of which you can configure through the SDK with optional configuration (view the SDK documentation for more information on this).

:::warning

It's important that the generated JWT token is sent back to the client-side as a **secure http-only cookie** to prevent it from being used in XSS attacks. You can see an example of how to do this in our [Basic Authentication Example](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/login-with-wallet/blob/2ecbf412fdb9888a1f3027ba6ff737b735e8cfb3/pages/api/login.tsx#L37).

### Authenticating Requests

Once a user has a JWT, they can make requests to the backend without needing to login again. You can then use the `authenticate` method to verify the user is authenticated and to get their connected wallet address:

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract="WalletAuthenticator" name="authenticate" languages={{ react: false }} groupId="thirdweb-code-snippet-no-react" />
