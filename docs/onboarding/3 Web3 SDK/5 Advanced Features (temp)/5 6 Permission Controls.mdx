### Update Roles

1. Read the current roles from the `get` function.
2. Modify the array for the role you want to update.
3. Call the `setAll` function with the modified array.

```javascript
const rolesAndMembers = await contract.roles.getAll();

const updatedRoles = {
  ...rolesAndMembers,
  admin: [...rolesAndMembers.admin, "0x-new-address-here"],
};

await contract.roles.setAll(updatedRoles);
```
