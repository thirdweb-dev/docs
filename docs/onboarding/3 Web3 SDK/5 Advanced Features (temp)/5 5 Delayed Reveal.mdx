# Delayed Reveals

<div className="heroGrid">

    <p>
Delayed reveals are a way to show placeholder metadata for NFTs, and use a password to reveal the metadata at a later time.
    </p>

You store a password that is encrypted on-chain, and later use this same password to reveal the metadata for your NFTs.
