# Gasless Transactions

Gasless Transactions use a relayer to forward transactions to another wallet (typically the contract owner),
allowing you to cover the gas costs of interacting with your smart contract for other users.

For a step-by-step tutorial on how to configure this feature, check out our guide: [Learn how to set up gasless transactions](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/setup-gasless-transactions).
