      Our SDKs enable you to build web3 applications, with capabilities such as:

    <ul>
      <li>Connecting to user's wallets</li>
      <li>Deploying and interacting with smart contracts</li>
      <li>

  We support the following frameworks <i>(and are working on more)</i> to make
  it easier for you to build applications.

<SupportedLanguagesSection
  languages={["React", "JavaScript", "Python", "Go"]}
/>

## Quick Start

Set up a new web application with the [React](/react) and [JavaScript](/javascript) SDKs set up using the CLI.

```bash
npx thirdweb create app
```

Start with a basic configuration with the language and framework of your choice,
or choose one of our [templates](/templates) to get a headstart by passing the `--template` flag and the name of a [template repository](/templates).

## Using the SDK

Depending on the type of application you want to build, we've separated the getting started
flow into two pages.

1. [Frontend Applications](/sdk/set-up-the-sdk/frontend): **Web-applications** that connect to users' wallets to let them interact with smart contracts.
2. [React Native Applications](/react-native): Mobile applications that connect to users' wallets to let them interact with smart contracts.
3. [Backend & Scripting](/sdk/set-up-the-sdk/backend): Use your own wallet to interact with smart contracts.
