# Interacting with Contracts

<div className="heroGrid">
  
<div>

Connect to any smart contract deployed to one of our
supported networks and start calling functions on it using the SDK.

Once you have [set up the SDK](/sdk/set-up-the-sdk/frontend), any interaction
you make with a smart contract will be made from the connected wallet automatically.

[Extensions](/solidity/extensions) implemented on your smart contract become
available as functionality on your `contract` in the SDK; such as
[ERC721](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/erc721),
[ERC1155](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/erc1155), and
[ERC20](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/erc20).

## Call Contract functions

[Read](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/custom-contracts/using-contracts#read-contract-data) from
and [write](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/custom-contracts/using-contracts#write-transactions)
data to your smart contracts by providing:

1. The `contract` you connected to
2. The name of the function
3. Any parameters the function requires

    />
  </div>
</div>

## Using Contract Extensions

Any [extensions](/solidity/extensions) you implemented are **detected** by the SDK,
and can be utilized with convenience functions that get unlocked for you.

For example, if your contract implements the [`ERC721`](/solidity/erc721) extension,
you can utilize all of the functions of the [corresponding `erc721` standard](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/erc721)
in the SDK.

  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
