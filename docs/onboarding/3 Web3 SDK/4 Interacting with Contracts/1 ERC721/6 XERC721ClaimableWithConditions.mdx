# ERC721 - Claim Conditions

You can utilize these features of the SDK on your contract if it implements [Drop](/solidity/extension-contracts/dropsinglephase).

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 24 }}>
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ marginTop: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Learn how to implement Drop in your smart contract"
      link={"/solidity/extension-contracts/dropsinglephase"}
      image="/assets/icons/general.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Configure claim conditions

Define the criteria of how NFTs can be claimed from your drop.

Each claim phase can define:

- When the claim phase will start
- How many NFTs to drop
- How much to charge per NFT
- What currency to use to sell the NFTs
- Which wallet addresses are allowed to mint (allowlist)
- How many NFTs can be claimed per wallet
- Metadata for the claim condition
