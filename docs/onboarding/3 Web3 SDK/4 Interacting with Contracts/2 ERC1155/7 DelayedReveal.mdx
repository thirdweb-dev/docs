# ERC1155 - Delayed Reveal

You can utilize these features of the SDK on your contract if it implements [DelayedReveal](/solidity/extension-contracts/delayedreveal).

  <div className="col col--12" style={{ marginTop: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard

Create a batch of lazy-minted NFTs that have placeholder metadata you can reveal later.

This function encrypts the metadata and requires a **password** that is used to reveal it.

:::warning Password Management

This password is the **only** method you have to reveal the metadata of your NFTs.

thirdweb does not have any servers that can view or recover this password for you.

Ensure you remember this password and keep it safe.
