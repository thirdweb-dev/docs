# Pack

Learn how to interact with your [Pack](/pre-built-contracts/pack) contract in the SDK.

## Create a Pack Contract

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"ContractDeployer"} name={"deployPack"} />

## Getting the contract in your application

To start using your Pack contract inside your application, you'll need to use its contract address.
You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"Pack"}
  name={"initializing the SDK"}
  isGetContractCode
  dontShowSummary
/>

## Setting Royalty Fees

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Pack"} name={"royalties"} />

## Create a Pack

You can bundle any number of ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155 tokens into a set quantity of ERC1155 pack NFTs.

When you create a pack, it is minted as a new NFT in the smart contract.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Pack"} name={"createTo"} dontShowSummary />

## Add more contents to an existing Pack

You can add ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155 tokens to a an existing packId, up till the first transfer of those packs.

When you add contents, an additional supply of ERC1155 pack NFTs is minted for a packId.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"Pack"}
  name={"addPackContents"}
  dontShowSummary
/>

## Airdrop a Pack

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Pack"} name={"airdrop"} />

## View Packs

### One

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Pack"} name={"get"} />

### All

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Pack"} name={"getAll"} />

### Owned by a specific wallet

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Pack"} name={"getOwned"} />

### Amount owned by a specific wallet

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Pack"} name={"balanceOf"} />

## View Pack Contents

You can view all of the rewards that were bundled to create the packs, but not the contents of each individual pack.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"Pack"}
  name={"getPackContents"}
  dontShowSummary
/>

## Open Pack

When you open a pack, you receive the tokens within it and **burn** the pack NFT.

Only the owner of a pack can open it.

Multiple of the same pack can be opened at once.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Pack"} name={"open"} dontShowSummary />

## Transferring NFTs

You must be the owner of the pack you're trying to transfer for this to be successful.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"Pack"}
  name={"transfer"}
  dontShowSummary
  showHr={false}
/>
