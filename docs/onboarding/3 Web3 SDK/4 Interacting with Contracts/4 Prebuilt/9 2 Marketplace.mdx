# Marketplace

Learn how to interact with your [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace) contract in the SDK.

## Create a Marketplace Contract

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"ContractDeployer"}
  name={"deployMarketplace"}
/>

## Getting the contract in your application

To start using your Marketplace contract inside your application, you'll need to use its contract address.
You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"Marketplace"}
  name={"initializing the SDK"}
  isGetContractCode
  dontShowSummary
/>

## Creating Listings

### Creating a new Direct Listing

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"MarketplaceDirect"} name={"createListing"} />

### Creating a new Auction Listing

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"MarketplaceAuction"}
  name={"createListing"}
/>

## Viewing Listings

### One Listing

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Marketplace"} name={"getListing"} />

### All Listings

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Marketplace"} name={"getAllListings"} />

### Active Listings

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Marketplace"} name={"getActiveListings"} />

## Creating Offers / Bids

### Direct Listings

**Offers** are made on direct listings.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"MarketplaceDirect"}
  name={"makeOffer"}
  dontShowSummary
/>

### Auction Listings

**Bids** are made on auction listings.

- Once a bid is made, it cannot be withdrawn.
- Bids must be higher than either the **reserve price**, OR if there is an existing bid, it must be higher than the current bid by a certain percentage -
  (see [Auction Bid Buffers](#auction-bid-buffers)).
- The previous highest bid is refunded automatically when a higher bid is made.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"MarketplaceAuction"}
  name={"makeBid"}
  dontShowSummary
/>

## Buying an NFT from a Listing

Buying a listing is the same for both direct listings and auction listings.

When a `buyout` is made, the NFT is transferred to the buyer, and the seller receives the funds immediately.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"Marketplace"}
  name={"buyoutListing"}
  dontShowSummary
/>

## Accept Offers (Direct Only)

Offers can only be accepted on direct listings.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"MarketplaceDirect"}
  name={"acceptOffer"}
  dontShowSummary
/>

## Cancel a Listing

### Direct Listing

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"MarketplaceDirect"} name={"cancelListing"} />

### Auction Listing

Auction listings **cannot** be canceled after a bid has been made.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"MarketplaceAuction"}
  name={"cancelListing"}
  dontShowSummary
/>

## Close a Listing (Auction Only)

When an auction is finished, the `closeAuction` needs to be called for both the **buyer** and the **seller**.

The `closeAuction` function takes in a `closeFor` parameter.

- When the `closeFor` value is the address of the **buyer**, they are transferred the funds from the highest bid.

- When the `closeFor` value is the address of the **seller**, the NFT is transferred to them.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"MarketplaceAuction"}
  name={"closeListing"}
  dontShowSummary

### Winning Bid

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"MarketplaceAuction"}
  name={"getWinningBid"}
/>

### Auction Winner

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"MarketplaceAuction"} name={"getWinner"} />

## Auction Bid Buffers

We made a few important considerations for auctions in our smart contract.

- When someone makes a bid in an auction, the time until the auction is finished is extended by a set amount you can configure to avoid users not bidding at the last possible second to win the auction.
- The user must bid a certain percentage higher than the current highest bid to prevent users from bidding minuscule amounts above the previous bid.
