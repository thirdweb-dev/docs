# Delayed Reveals

Delayed reveals are a way to show placeholder metadata for NFTs, and use a password to reveal the metadata at a later time.

Currently, delayed reveal is only supported on the [NFT Drop](/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop) contract.

For a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up an NFT Drop with delayed reveal, check out our guide: [Release an NFT drop with delayed reveal without writing any code](/guides/nft-drop-with-delayed-reveal).
