## Using this template

This template uses the [authentication SDK](https://thirdweb.com/authentication)
along with Discord OAuth to grant users who own an NFT from a specific collection a special role
in a Discord server.

## Tools:

- [**React SDK**](https://docs.thirdweb.com/react): To connect to the user's MetaMask wallet.

- [**TypeScript SDK**](https://docs.thirdweb.com/typescript): To view the balance of the connected wallet in an NFT collection.

- [**Authentication SDK**](https://thirdweb.com/authentication) to allow the user to sign in with Ethereum and verify they own their wallet.

- [**Next Auth**](https://next-auth.js.org/): To authenticate with Discord and access the user's Discord data such as their user ID.

- [**Discord API**](https://discord.com/developers/docs) to grant users a role in our Discord server.

## Using This Repo

To create a clone of this repository, you can use the [thirdweb CLI](https://portal.thirdweb.com/thirdweb-cli)

```bash

```

# Guide

You can follow along with the guide below to set this up for your Discord server and role.

### Setting Up the Discord Bot

To create a Discord bot, head to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click on `New Application`, give it a name and click `create`!

Once it's created, head to the `Bot` tab, and click `Add Bot`.

Give your bot a username, and I'm unchecking the `Public Bot` field so that only we can invite our bot.

Scroll down to `Bot Permissions` and give our bot the `Manage Roles` permission:

Once you're ready, click `Save Changes`!

Now we're ready to invite our bot to our server!

Click `OAuth2` > `URL Generator` on the sidebar:

Select `bot` and `Manage Roles` scopes.

Copy the Generated URL and open it in your browser.

Select the server you want to add your bot to and click `Continue`. It will ask you to approve this bot's permissions, you should see a prompt to authorise the bot for `Manage Roles` permissions:

Click `Authorise`, once successful, you'll see an `Authorised` window. Your bot will be added to your server - say hi!

Copy across your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` into environment variables in your project, by creating a `.env.local` file at the root of the directory.

```text
CLIENT_ID=xxxxx
CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxx
```

We also need to add a Redirect URL into our Application while we're here:

To grant a role to the connected user, we are going to use the Discord API on behalf of the bot that we created. Specifically, we'll be hitting the `Add Guild Member Role` API endpoint:

To make requests from our bot, we'll need a token to act on its behalf. To generate a token, head to the `Bot` tab from your Discord Developer portal, and click `Reset Token` on your bot:

We then need to store this inside our environment variables as well securely:

```text
BOT_TOKEN=xxxx
```

Finally, inside the [grant-roles.ts](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/discord-role-granter/blob/main/pages/api/grant-role.ts) file, you need to configure your:

- Discord Server ID
- Role ID
- NFT Collection ID

You can learn how to do that from [this guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-).

### thirdweb and NextAuth Wrappers

To authenticate users with both their **wallet** and their Discord account, we wrap our application in two Provider components:

```tsx
// This is the chainId your dApp will work on.
const activeChainId = ChainId.Mumbai;

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={activeChainId}>
      <SessionProvider session={pageProps.session}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
        <ThirdwebGuideFooter />
      </SessionProvider>
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

This allows us to access the helpful hooks of the React SDK and NextAuth to read information about the current user and their wallet.

### Discord Oauth

NextAuth handles the Oauth flow of signing in with Discord for us in
the [[...nextauth.ts]](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/discord-role-granter/blob/main/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts) file.
We add some additional logic to append the user ID to the
information that is available to us so that we can read that inside our API route.

```tsx
export default NextAuth({
  // Configure one or more authentication providers
  providers: [
    DiscordProvider({
      clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID as string,
      clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET as string,
    }),
  ],

  // When the user signs in, get their token
  callbacks: {
    async jwt({ token, account }) {
      // Persist the user ID to the token right after signin
      if (account) {
        token.userId = account.providerAccountId;
      }
      return token;
    },

    async session({ session, token, user }) {
      session.userId = token.userId;
      return session;
    },
  },
});
```

### Connect Wallet & Sign In With Discord

We have a component called [SignIn](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/discord-role-granter/blob/main/components/SignIn.tsx) that shows the user different buttons
depending on whether they have their wallet connected and Discord account connected.

In this component, three states can occur:

1. The user is connected to both `wallet` and `Discord` => We show them the `Give me the role` button.
2. The user is not connected to `wallet` => We ask them to connect their wallet.
3. The user is not connected to `Discord`=> We ask them to authenticate with Discord.

### Authenticating Wallet

Once users have signed in with their wallet and Discord account, they are shown a button that makes an API
request to grant them a role in the Discord server.

First, we need to prove that the user owns the wallet by using the authentication SDK.

**Sign in with ethereum**:

```tsx
// First, login and sign a message
const domain = "thirdweb.com";
const loginPayload = await sdk?.auth.login(domain);
console.log(loginPayload);
```

**Make the request to the API route with the login payload**

```tsx
// Then make a request to our API endpoint.
try {
  const response = await fetch("/api/grant-role", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      loginPayload,
    }),
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
  alert("Check the console for the response!");
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

**Verify the login payload on the server**

```tsx
const { loginPayload } = JSON.parse(req.body);
// Authenticate login payload
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK("mumbai");
const domain = "thirdweb.com";
// Verify the login payload is real and valid
const verifiedWalletAddress = sdk.auth.verify(domain, loginPayload);
```

### Checking NFT Balance

Using the TypeScript SDK, we can check the balance of the wallet for a specific ERC-1155 token in a specific collection.

```tsx
// Check if this user owns an NFT
const editionDrop = sdk.getEditionDrop(
  "0x1fCbA150F05Bbe1C9D21d3ab08E35D682a4c41bF",
);

// Get addresses' balance of token ID 0
const balance = await editionDrop.balanceOf(verifiedWalletAddress, 0);
```

### Granting Role

Using our Discord bot's token as the authorization header, we can grant the user a role in the Discord server
_if_ they own an NFT in the collection.

```tsx
if (balance.toNumber() > 0) {
  // If the user is verified and has an NFT, return the content

  // Make a request to the Discord API to get the servers this user is a part of
  const discordServerId = "999533680663998485";
  const { userId } = session;
  const roleId = "999851736028172298";
  const response = await fetch(
    // Discord Developer Docs for this API Request: https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#add-guild-member-role
    `https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/${discordServerId}/members/${userId}/roles/${roleId}`,
    {
      headers: {
        // Use the bot token to grant the role
        Authorization: `Bot ${process.env.BOT_TOKEN}`,
      },
      method: "PUT",
    },
  );

  // If the role was granted, return the content
  if (response.ok) {
    res.status(200).json({ message: "Role granted" });
  }

  // Something went wrong granting the role, but they do have an NFT
  else {
    const resp = await response.json();
    console.error(resp);
    res
      .status(500)
      .json({ error: "Error granting role, are you in the server?" });
  }
}
```
