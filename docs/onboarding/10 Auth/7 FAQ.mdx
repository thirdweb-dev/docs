### How long does the JWT last until it expires?

### Is it possible to use Auth without an `authUrl` in the `authConfig` using the React SDK?

Yes, it is possible to use Auth without an `authUrl` in the `authConfig` using the React SDK. The `authUrl` property in the `authConfig` object is used to specify the backend URL of the authentication endpoints. However, if you don't need to communicate with a backend for authentication purposes, you can omit this property. In that case, Auth will use default authentication mechanisms such as cookies.

### Can I token gate my website using Auth?

Yes, you can token gate your website using Auth. Token gating allows you to restrict access to certain pages or content on your website based on the ownership of a specific token, such as an NFT or a crypto token. By connecting their crypto wallet and verifying ownership of the required token, users can unlock exclusive content or features.
