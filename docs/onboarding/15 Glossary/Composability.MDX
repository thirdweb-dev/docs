Composability refers to the ability for different protocols and smart contracts to interact and build upon each other. 
It allows for the creation of new products and services without having to build everything from scratch. 

Thirdweb is completely composible. Each product can be used independently or in combination with other products.
For example, you can use the [SDKs](/sdk) or [Dashabord](/dashboard) with **any** contract. Similarly, you can use the [Solidity SDK](/solidity) 
without using the [Dashboard](/dashboard) or [JavaScript SDK](/javascript). 
So, if you already have your own workflow which works for you, you can pick and choose which products you want to use.
