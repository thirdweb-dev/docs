A local wallet is a type of wallet that allows you to create wallets within your application or project.

It is a non-custodial solution that simplifies the onboarding process by offering a "checkout as guest" experience.
This improves the user experience for web3 apps in two ways:

1. It enables non-web3 native users to get started easily without having to create a wallet with an external provider like MetaMask.
2. It hides transaction confirmations from users. With a local wallet, you can generate wallets on the backend,
   and each app can have one wallet that is app-scoped.

Additionally, the local wallet has [UI functionality](/react/react.connectwallet), available within the [React SDK](/react) and [React Native SDK](/react-native), that allows users to export and optionally store the encrypted key on their browser,
mobile, or other devices.
