By combining [Smart Wallet](/smart-wallet) and [Embedded Wallet](/embedded-wallet), you can create a truly seamless user experience:

- Gasless transactions
- Batched transactions
- Full account recovery for both the embedded wallet “key” and the smart wallet

Let’s create an app that creates smart wallets for our users.

These smart wallets will require a **“personal wallet”** to access and initialize the wallet. For this personal wallet, we will of course use an embedded wallet.

From the user's perspective, they will log in with their email or social account. Under the hood, an embedded wallet is created for them, and then a smart wallet is created and initialized using the embedded wallet.

When the user connects a wallet by entering their email, they will be able to view & interact with their smart wallet:

## Example Repo

View a fully functioning project on GitHub:

<div className="col col--12" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
  <QuickstartCard
    name="Source Code"
    link="https://github.com/thirdweb-example/embedded-smart-wallet"
    image="/assets/github-icon.webp"
  />
</div>

## 1. Deploy an Account Factory

Deployable via the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/smart-wallet) or build your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract using the [Solidity SDK](/solidity/base-contracts/smart-accounts).

Select the appropriate thirdweb smart wallet type for your app:

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 12, padding: 8, paddingTop: 0 }}>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Account Factory"
      link="https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/AccountFactory"
      image="/assets/wallets/smart-wallet.svg"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Managed Account Factory"
      link="https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/ManagedAccountFactory"
      image="/assets/wallets/smart-wallet.svg"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="col col--4" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Dynamic Account Factory"
      link="https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DynamicAccountFactory"
      image="/assets/wallets/smart-wallet.svg"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## 2. Enable smart wallets in your app

To enable smart wallets in your app, you need to add `smartWallet()` to the list of supported wallets in the `ThirdwebProvider`:

```jsx
import {
  ThirdwebProvider,
  ConnectWallet,
  embeddedWallet,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      activeChain="goerli"
      clientId="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
      supportedWallets={[
        smartWallet(embeddedWallet(), {
          factoryAddress: "YOUR_FACTORY_ADDRESS",
          gasless: true,
        }),
      ]}
    >
      <ConnectWallet />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

This will create an embedded wallet and a smart wallet for the user. The smart wallet will be initialized with the embedded wallet as the owner.

Pass your deployed `factoryAddress` to the `smartWallet()` function. This will allow the smart wallet to be be deployed only when the user sends their first transaction.

You can sponsor transactions simply by passing `gasless: true` to the `smartWallet()` function. This will allow the smart wallet to send transactions without the user needing to hold any ETH.
