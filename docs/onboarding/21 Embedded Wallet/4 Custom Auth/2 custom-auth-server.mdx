# Create a custom auth server

Learn how to integrate your auth backend with our embedded wallets solution so you can onboard your users into web3 seamlessly. 

This guide will show you how to create your own Auth Server that is compatible with the `auth_endpoint` strategy. By doing so, you can have full control over user authentication and data security. This allows you to ensure that your application meets specific compliance requirements while also providing a customized sign-in experience.

:::caution
This guide is simplified for demonstration purposes and is not ready for production use. When modifying it for production, secure your endpoints and avoid hard-coding secrets or sensitive information. We recommend using environment variables and secret managers.

## 5 minute quickstart

1. Navigate to Wallets > [Embedded Wallets](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/wallets/embedded) in the thirdweb dashboard.
2. Create a thirdweb API key if you don't have one or select an existing key to use for this project. [Learn more about API keys.](https://portal.thirdweb.com/api-keys)

   ![Embedded wallet dashboard with create key displayed](../assets/ew-create-key.png)

3. Allowlist domain or bundle ids in Access Restrictions.
4. Navigate to the Configuration view and enable **Custom Auth Endpoint**

   ![Configuration view for embedded wallet](../assets/ew-custom-auth-config.png)

5. Set the Auth Endpoint URL to `https://embedded-wallet.thirdweb.com/api/2023-11-30/embedded-wallet/auth/test-custom-auth-endpoint` for testing purposes. You will replace this later with your own auth server endpoint to verify the `payload`.
6. Save the configuration.
7. Copy the client ID.
8. In your preferred thirdweb client SDK, pass the payload you retrieved from logging in to the server.

You can now auth into the wallet and use it to sign transactions like so (see [use your own auth for more](/embedded-wallet/custom-auth)):

In React and React Native, the `useEmbeddedWallet()` hook handles authentication and connection states.

```typescript
import { useEmbeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react"; // or /react-native

const embeddedWallet = useEmbeddedWallet();

const handlePostLogin = async () => {
  await embeddedWallet.connect({
    strategy: "auth_endpoint",
    // in production this would be your public identifier for the user
    payload: JSON.stringify({ userId:"ANY_RANDOM_ID_HERE" }), 
    encryptionKey: "ANY_RANDOM_STRING_HERE"
  });
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="Other Typescript Frameworks">

In other frameworks, use your own instance of the wallet to authenticate and connect.

```typescript
import { EmbeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
import { Goerli } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

const embeddedWallet = new EmbeddedWallet({
  chain: Goerli, //  chain to connect to
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", // Your thirdweb client ID
});

const authResult = await embeddedWallet.authenticate({
  strategy: "auth_endpoint",
  payload: JSON.stringify({ userId:"ANY_RANDOM_ID_HERE" }),
  encryptionKey: "ANY_RANDOM_STRING_HERE"=
});

const walletAddress = await embeddedWallet.connect({ authResult });
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

A persistent, cross-platform wallet is now created for your user!

Of course, you would use your own auth server instead of the one we provided. The rest of this guide will show you how to create your own auth server.

### Setup

The following steps will show you how to create a simple auth server that can be used with the embedded wallet.

At a high level, the auth server will:

1. Handle login for the user into your application.
2. Have a way to get a public identifier for the user.
3. Have an endpoint to verify the public identifier and return some basic information about the user

Steps 1 and 2 are up to you to implement. You can use any auth strategy you want.

The endpoint in step 3 is what your register as your auth endpoint on the thirdweb dashboard.

Here's a high level diagram:
![custom auth flow diagram](../assets/ew-custom-auth-flow.png)

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your CLI

   ```bash
   mkdir custom-auth-server
   cd custom-auth-server
   ```

2. Initialize a new Node.js application

   ```bash
   npm init -y

   yarn init -y
   ```

### **Create the Server:**

1. In the `custom-auth-server` directory, create a file at the root named `server.js` and paste the following:

   ```jsx
   const express = require("express");
   const fs = require("fs");

   const app = express();
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

   const users = [
     { id: 1, email: "user@example.com", password: "password123" },
   ];

   app.use(express.json());

   // This is what your app calls to login a user and get a public identifier for the user (otherwise known as the payload)
   app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
     const { email, password } = req.body;
     const user = users.find(
       (u) => u.email === email && u.password === password,
     );
     if (!user) return res.status(401).send({ message: "Invalid credentials" });

     res.send({ payload: user.id });
   });
   // This is a sample endpoint that yuou would register on the thirdweb dashboard for us to verify the payload
   app.get("/thirdweb-will-call-this", (req, res) => {
     const { payload } = req.body;
     if (!payload) return res.status(401).send({ message: "Invalid credentials" });

     // you would write your own logic here to verify the payload here
     const user = users.find((u) => u.id === payload);
     if (!user) return res.status(401).send({ message: "Invalid credentials" });

     // once the user is successfully verified, you can return the following field
     return res.send({
         userId: user.id,
         // the last two fields here are optional
         email: user.email,
         exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60 * 60 * 24 * 30,
      });
   });

   app.listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`Server started on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

### **Test Locally**

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. Test login:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password123"}'
   ```

### **Deploy**

To deploy the server, you can use use services such as [Zeet](https://zeet.co/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

### **Integrate Embedded Wallets**

Refer top the [quickstart above](#5-minute-quickstart) to integrate the embedded wallet into your application.
