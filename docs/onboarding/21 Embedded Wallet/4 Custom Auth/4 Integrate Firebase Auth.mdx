# Integrate Firebase Auth

Learn how to obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT) from Firebase using Firebase’s email provider and integrate it with Embedded Wallet.

:::info
This article covers the steps of integrating Firebase Auth for a React Native app. Firebase steps and the Embedded Wallet code may be replicated for React.
:::

## Prerequisites

- Firebase project
- React Native CLI installed

### Create a React Native app

To skip over initialization steps, we will use the React Native TypeScript starter template. You may also integrate this functionality into an existing application by installing the React Native SDK.

1. Create the template from the CLI:

   ```jsx
   npx thirdweb create --template react-native-typescript-starter
   ```

   This command will create a React Native app with the `@thirdweb-dev/react-native` SDK already installed.

2. Note that we assume this is a simple app with a single screen `App.tsx`.

### Set up your Firebase project

1. Set up a React Native Firebase project by following the [prerequisites in the React Native Firebase documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/#1-install-via-npm).
2. Navigate to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
3. Navigate to Authentication > Sign-in method, to enable the [Email/Password provider](https://rnfirebase.io/auth/usage#emailpassword-sign-in)

### Set up the custom JSON Web Keys link through dashboard

1. Navigate to Wallets > [Embedded Wallets](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/wallets/embedded)
2. To use embedded wallets, choose an existing API key or create a new one. Learn more about API keys.

3. In the configuration view, enable **Custom JSON Web Token.**

4. Set the **JWKS URI** as the following URL:

   ```jsx
   [https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com](https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com)
   ```

5. Set the AUD Value as the Firebase projectId. (Example, `custom-auth-53169`)

6. Select **Save changes**.

### Add the Firebase auth dependencies

Firebase auth depends on the `firebase/app` and `firebase/auth` packages.

1. To add the packages, run the following command in the project:

   ```jsx
   yarn add @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth
   ```

### Implement Email Authentication

Add the code snippet below to handle email authentication with Firebase. Note that you need to add UI to allow users to input the email and password fields in your `App.tsx` file:

1. To handle email authentication with Firebase

   ```jsx
   import auth from '@react-native-firebase/auth';

   ...
   async function signInWithEmail(email, password) {
     try {
       await auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(error);
     }
   }

   return <Button
   					title="Sign In"
   					onPress={() => signInWithEmail(email, password)}/>
   ...
   ```

   Note: You may add a UI to allow users to input email and password fields.

### Obtain the JWT

Once the user is authenticated, you can listen to `AuthStateChanged` [events to get the signed in user](https://rnfirebase.io/auth/usage#listening-to-authentication-state). You can then get the JWT from the User object:

1. To receive the signed in user, listen to the `AuthStateChanged` event. You can add this code in your App.tsx file as well:

   ```jsx
   const [user, setUser] = useState();

   function onAuthStateChanged(user) {
     setUser(user);
   }

   useEffect(() => {
     // Listens to AuthStateChanged events
     const subscriber = auth().onAuthStateChanged(onAuthStateChanged);
     return subscriber;
   }, [onAuthStateChanged]);

   async function getFirebaseJWT() {
     if (user) {
       return await user.getIdToken();
     } else {
       throw new Error("User is not authenticated");
     }
   }
   ```

### Pass the JWT to EmbeddedWallet

1. Pass the JWT to the Embedded Wallet config in your `App.tsx` file:

   ```jsx
   import { useEmbeddedWallet } from '@thirdweb-dev/react-native';

   const connectEmbedded = useEmbeddedWallet();

   ...
   await connectEmbedded({
     strategy: 'jwt',
     jwt: await getFirebaseJWT()
   });
   ...
   ```

   After the connectEmbedded function returns, the ThirdwebProvider will have connected a wallet thereby granting access to all hooks and functionalities.

### Access the connected wallet

1. To access the connected wallet, use the `useWallet()` hook:

   ```jsx
   import { useWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

   const activeWallet = useWallet();
   ```
