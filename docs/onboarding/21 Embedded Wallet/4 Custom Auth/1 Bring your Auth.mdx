By default, the embedded wallet service handles two things: auth, and spinning up crypto wallets tied to the auth. We require
valid authentication to ensure a wallet is created for the right person.
If you already have your own auth and only want to spin up wallets, we offer a simple way to hook up any auth to create embedded wallets.

## How it works

We offer two kinds of custom auth. One that is based on the OIDC standard, and one that is is based on you having you bring your own auth server.

### Bring your own auth server

- You have your own auth server that you use to authenticate users
- When a user logs in, you are able to generate a public identifier that allows you to identify the user.
- You can pass this identifier to the embedded wallet to generate a wallet for the user.
- When verifying the user, we will hit an endopint that you provide to verify the user's identity.
- We will then generate a wallet for the user if the provided payload is valid.

### OIDC

- An OIDC auth system has a public-private keypair, where the private key is used to sign auth tokens
- The public key is uploaded to a public URL in JWKS format. The standard location is `https://{domain}.com/.well-known/jwks.json`
- When a user logs in, a JWT token called the idToken is generated and signed by the private key. The OIDC spec provides an interface for fields that are used in this token.
- This JWT is then passed to the embedded wallet to generate a wallet for the user.
- We will verify the JWT against the public key to verify that the JWT was signed correctly. Upon successful verification, we will proceed to generate a wallet based on the `sub` (user identifier) value of the idToken.

## Configuration Setup

In your API key settings, click edit, look for "Custom Auth" and provide the following values:

### Bring your own auth server

- An endpoint that we can hit to verify the user's identity
  - This endpoint should accept a POST request with a JSON body containing the following fields:
    - `payload`: This will correspont to the public identifier that was generated for your user.
  - The endpoint should return a JSON body containing the following fields:
    - `userId`: A uid for the user. Note that you can only create one wallet per `userId` at this point
    - `email` (optional): If provided, the user will be able to access the same account outside of the platform for things like private key export // using with wallet connect etc.
    - `exp` (optional): An expiration date for the user's wallet session. By default a session is 7 days long.
- A list of custom headers (optional)
  - These headers will be sent with every request to your verification endpoint. You can use these to authenticate the request.

### OIDC

- The URL of the JWKS file (public key)
  - This is used to verify the token was signed by you.
- The `aud` value of the idToken
  - This is used to verify that thirdweb is the intended user of the token

## Authenticating a user

Once you've logged in with your own auth, you can pass the user's detail to the embedded wallet to authenticate and connect.

<TabItem value="react" label="React & React Native">

In React and React Native, the `useEmbeddedWallet()` hook handles authentication and connection states.

```typescript
import { useEmbeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react"; // or /react-native

const embeddedWallet = useEmbeddedWallet();

const handlePostLogin = async (jwt: string) => {
  await embeddedWallet.connect({
    strategy: "auth_endpoint",
    payload,
  });
};
```

In other frameworks, use your own instance of the wallet to authenticate and connect.

```typescript
import { EmbeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
import { Goerli } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

const embeddedWallet = new EmbeddedWallet({
  chain: Goerli, //  chain to connect to
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", // Your thirdweb client ID
});

const authResult = await embeddedWallet.authenticate({
