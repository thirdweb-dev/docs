## Using this template

<p align="center">
  This template showcases a basic Solidity smart contract with a full
  development and deployment environment set up.
</p>

<br />

<b>Tools used in this template: </b>

[Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/) for the development language of our smart contract

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for the development environment (testing, debugging, etc.)

[thirdweb deploy](https://portal.thirdweb.com/thirdweb-deploy) to deploy the contract to the blockchain without using a private key

<br />

<b>Key Commands: </b>

`npx thirdweb deploy`: Deploy the smart contract

`npx hardhat test`: Run the test suite (unit tests)

<br />

<h2 align="center">How to use this template</h2>

<h3 align="left">
  <b>Exploring the Smart Contract</b>
</h3>

Take a look at the [`Greeter.sol`](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/hardhat-thirdweb-deploy-greeter/blob/main/contracts/Greeter.sol) file, you'll find a smart contract!

It's very basic, but it's a great starting point to explain how to build, test, and deploy smart contracts using Solidity.

Firstly, we declare our contract's [License](https://spdx.org/licenses/) and [Solidity Version](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases).

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;
```

Then, we define our first `contract`, called `Greeter`!

A `contract` is a smart contract, which is a collection containing:

1. Functions
2. Data / State

That live at a specific address on the blockchain.

```solidity
contract Greeter {

}
```

We define a `variable` (data) called `greeting`, which is a `private` `string`.

This just means it is not publicly accessible by other contracts or users.

```solidity
string private greeting;
```

The `constructor` is what gets called when the contract is first created.

When we deploy the contract, we'll let the contract know what the initial value of the `greeting` variable is, by passing in a `string` as an argument and setting the value of `greeting` to that string.

```
constructor(string memory _greeting) {
    greeting = _greeting;
}
```

Since we made our `greeting` variable `private`, we can write a `view` that reads and returns the value of the `greeting` variable.

Since this is `public`, it can be accessed by other contracts or users. You'll also notice the `view` keyword, which means this function will not modify any state or data in our contract; it simply just returns some data to the caller.

```solidity
function greet() public view returns (string memory) {
    return greeting;
}
```

Finally, we have a `function` called `setGreeting`, which takes in a `string` as an argument and sets the value of `greeting` to that string.

This allows a user to change the value of `greeting` to something else.

```solidity
function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public {
    greeting = _greeting;
}
```

<h3 align="left">
  <b>Deploying the smart contract</b>
</h3>

To deploy the contract to the blockchain, run the below script:

```bash
npx thirdweb deploy
```

This command uses [thirdweb deploy](https://portal.thirdweb.com/thirdweb-deploy) to:

1. Compile your smart contract and detect any errors
2. Upload the contract ABI to IPFS
3. Generate a URL to deploy the contract on the thirdweb dashboard.

<h3 align="left">
  <b>Testing the Contract</b>
</h3>

To run the test suite and see if your contract works as you expect, run the below script:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```
