# Signature Drop

Use the signature drop pre-built contract to claim NFTs under a claim phase as well as claim using signature-based minting!

To create a new project using this template, use the [thirdweb CLI](/thirdweb-deploy/thirdweb-cli):

```jsx
npx thirdweb create --template signature-drop
```

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "row",
    gap: "2%",
    marginBottom: 32,
    width: "100%",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginTop: 16,
  }}
>
  <DemoButton
    link="http://signature-drop.thirdweb-example.com/"
    name="signature-drop"
  />
  <ViewCodeButton
    link="https://github.com/thirdweb-example/signature-drop"
    name="signature-drop"
  />
</div>

## Using this template

This example shows how you can use the [Signature Drop Pre-Built Contract](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/signature-drop) to
utilize both the [claim](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/signature-drop#minting--claiming-nfts) function to claim NFTs under the criteria
of a claim condition, as well as the [Signature-based minting](https://portal.thirdweb.com/advanced-features/on-demand-minting) feature to
offer free NFT mints to specific users simultaneously.

We allow users who hold one of our [Early Access NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/thirdweb-community) to mint the NFT for free, by generating a mint signature from the admin wallet on the server-side. Whereas users who _don't_ hold one of the NFTs do not qualify for the mint signature, but can still mint an NFT from the drop using the regular claim.

## Tools

- [Signature Drop](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/signature-drop) to lazy mint NFTs for other wallets to claim.
- [React SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) to connect to user's wallets and interact with the smart contract.

## Create Your Own

You can create a project using this example with the [thirdweb CLI](https://portal.thirdweb.com/thirdweb-cli) by running the below command:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template signature-drop
```

Export your wallet's private key and add it to an `.env` file in your project directory.

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
```

## Guide

Let's explore the key areas of the application and how the code works.

### Connecting to user's wallets and our contract

We wrap our application in the `ThirdwebProvider` component in the [\_app.tsx](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/signature-drop/blob/main/pages/_app.tsx)

```jsx
// This is the chainId your dApp will work on.
const activeChainId = ChainId.Goerli;

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={activeChainId}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
      <ThirdwebGuideFooter />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

Now we can utilize all of the functionality of the [React SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) to connect to the user's wallets and their network on the [index.tsx](./pages/index.tsx) file.

```jsx
const address = useAddress();
const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();
const isMismatch = useNetworkMismatch();
const [, switchNetwork] = useNetwork();
```

We then connect to our signature drop contract by using its contract address:

```jsx
const signatureDrop = useSignatureDrop(
  "0xb90a18e9270d44F6e7D06e5Eac32C6Ea881CCaB2",
);
```

### Claiming NFTs

To claim NFTs the typical way, we use the `claimTo` function:

```jsx
const tx = await signatureDrop?.claimTo(address, 1);
```

### Signature-Based Minting NFTs

Signature-based minting is a three-step process:

1. The user requests a mint signature.
2. Admin wallet (on the server) approves (or denies) the claim request of the user based on any criteria the admin chooses and sends back a mint signature when they approve.
3. The user uses the mint signature to claim NFTs from the signature drop.

Firstly, we request a mint signature from the API:

```jsx
const signedPayloadReq = await fetch(`/api/generate-mint-signature`, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    address: address,
  }),
});
```

Then, on the server-side API route, we make a check to see if the user qualifies for the mint signature by checking to see if they own any early access NFTs:

```jsx
// De-construct body from request
const { address } = JSON.parse(req.body);

// Get the Early Access NFT Edition Drop contract
const polygonSDK = new ThirdwebSDK("polygon");
const earlyAccessNfts = polygonSDK.getEditionDrop(
  "0xa9e893cc12026a2f6bd826fdb295eac9c18a7e88",
);

// Check to see if the wallet address has an early access NFT
const numTokensInCollection = await earlyAccessNfts.getTotalCount();
let userHasToken = false;
// Check each token in the Edition Drop
for (let i = 0; i < numTokensInCollection.toNumber(); i++) {
  // See if they have the token
  const balance = await earlyAccessNfts.balanceOf(address, i);
  if (balance.toNumber() > 0) {
    userHasToken = true;
    break;
  }
}
```

If they do, we generate a mint signature from the admin wallet on the server-side:

```jsx
  // Now use the SDK on Goerli to get the signature drop
  const goerliSDK = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey(
    process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string,
    "goerli"
  );
  const signatureDrop = goerliSDK.getSignatureDrop(
    "0xb90a18e9270d44F6e7D06e5Eac32C6Ea881CCaB2"
  );

  // If the user has an early access NFT, generate a mint signature
  if (userHasToken) {
    const mintSignature = await signatureDrop.signature.generate({
      to: address, // Can only be minted by the address we checked earlier
      price: "0", // Free!
      mintStartTime: new Date(0), // now
    });

    res.status(200).json(mintSignature);
  } else {
    res.status(400).json({
      message: "User does not have an early access NFT",
    });
  }
```

When this is done, we handle it on the client-side, by showing an error alert if they didn't qualify, or continuing to use this mint signature to claim an NFT if they did:

```jsx
if (signedPayloadReq.status === 400) {
  alert(
    "Looks like you don't own an early access NFT :( You don't qualify for the free mint"
  );
  return;
} else {
  try {
    const signedPayload =
      (await signedPayloadReq.json()) as SignedPayload721WithQuantitySignature;

    const nft = await signatureDrop?.signature.mint(signedPayload);

    alert(`Succesfully minted NFT!`);
  } catch (error: any) {
    alert(error?.message);
  }
}
```
