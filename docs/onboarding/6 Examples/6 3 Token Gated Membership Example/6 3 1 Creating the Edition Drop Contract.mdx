# Creating an Edition Drop Contract

In this section, we'll show how to:

- Create the smart contract that will be used to store our NFTs.
- Configure the metadata such as the name, image, description, and royalty fees of the Edition Drop.
- Deploy the contract to a test network, and set up our [claim phases](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop#setting-claim-phases).

## Creating an Edition Drop Contract

To create an [Edition Drop](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop) contract,
head to the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) and connect your wallet.

Then click on the **Deploy New Contract** button.

Since we want to **lazy mint** our NFTs, as well as use the same asset for many NFTs,
the **Edition Drop** contract is best suited for this.

Select **Edition Drop** from the list of contracts and click **Deploy Now**.

![Select Edition Drop Contract](../assets/edition-drop-contract-on-dashboard.png)

You can configure the **Name**, **Symbol**, **Description**, **Image**, and
[Royalty fees](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop#setting-royalty-fees) in the settings before you deploy your Edition Drop.

I'll call my Edition Drop `Shape Club Membership Card` and stick with the default values for the rest of the fields,
but feel free to go wild and configure this to your liking!

Once you're happy, let's deploy this Edition Drop onto the Mumbai (MATIC) Test network.

This will prompt you to accept a transaction in MetaMask (or whatever wallet you connected with),
and deploy your smart contract onto the Mumbai Test network!

You might notice that the transaction is requesting to Deploy a **Proxy**.

If you want to learn more about proxy contracts, check out our documentation on
[How thirdweb pre-built contracts work](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts#how-thirdweb-pre-built-contracts-work).

Now we're ready to create our NFT inside this Edition Drop.

## Creating the Membership NFT

Let's create our NFT inside the Edition Drop by clicking the **Create** button.

![Create Membership NFT](../assets/create-membership-nft.png)

Enter a name, media file, description, properties, and advanced metadata for your Membership card NFT.

![Configure Edition NFT](../assets/configure-edition-nft.png)

Once you're happy, click **Create Edition Drop** and confirm the `Lazy Mint` transaction.

## Configuring Claim Phases

[Claim Phases](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop#setting-claim-phases) are conditions
we can configure to define **when** and **how** users can claim NFTs from our Edition Drop.

For example, a popular claim phase pattern is to have one claim phase where allow-listed wallets can claim,
then another claim phase after that, where _any_ wallet can claim.

In the Edition Drop contract, you can set different claim phases per NFT inside the edition.

From the thirdweb dashboard, click **Settings** on the NFT we just created to bring up the Claim Phase configuration.

Click on **Add Phase**, and configure it to your liking!

![Configure Claim Phases](../assets/configure-edition-claim-phases.png)

I will change the `How many NFTs can be claimed per transaction?` to be `1` and accept the default values for the other fields.

![Update Claim Phases](../assets/update-claim-phases.png)

Once you're happy with your claim phase(s), click **Update Claim Phases** and approve the transaction!

Now you're ready for users to claim the NFT!
