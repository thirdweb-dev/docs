# Edition

thirdweb's Edition contract is a **n-of-1** or **n-of-many** NFT Collection, that follows the [ERC1155 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) also known as "Semi-Fungible Tokens".

The **Edition** contract is best used when you want to release many NFTs based on the same asset, but you **don't** want to "drop" or "release" them for your community to claim.

Unlike the [Edition Drop](/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop) contract, the Edition contract does not **lazy mint** your NFTs. Instead, NFTs are minted immediately when they are added to the collection.

This means you can still transfer the NFTs or sell them on a [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace) and perform any other actions you would expect to do with an NFT.

You could use the Edition contract to:

- Create an NFT Collection where each NFT has 100 copies
- Airdrop an NFT to a list of addresses that all use the same asset and metadata
- Create 10 "copies" of your artwork and sell them on a [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace)

## Create an Edition Contract

Learn how to create any of thirdweb's pre-built contracts via the [Deploying Contracts page](/getting-started/deploying-contracts).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"ContractDeployer"} name={"deployEdition"} />

## Getting the contract in your application

To start using your Edition contract inside your application, you'll need to use its contract address. You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet
  contract={"Edition"}
  name={"initializing the SDK"}
  isGetContractCode
/>

## Setting Royalty Fees

Royalty fees are fees you earn on secondary sales of your NFTs. For example, if you sell an NFT on the marketplace, and it is then sold again to another user, you will earn a royalty fee.

### Using the dashboard

From the dashboard, in the **Settings** tab, you can set the royalty **percentage** and the **address** that should receive the revenue from royalties earned from secondary sales of the assets.

### Using the thirdweb SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Edition"} name={"royalty"} />

## Minting NFTs

With an Edition contract, you choose which wallet addresses can mint NFTs into your collection.

Only you (the smart contract owner) can mint NFTs into the collection by default.

You can specify which wallets can mint in the **Permissions** tab of your NFT Collection under the **Creator** section.

For more advanced use-cases, such as creating a **community-made collection**, you can use [signature-based minting](/typescript/sdk.erc1155signatureminting).

### Using the dashboard

For a more in-depth guide on how to create an NFT Collection, check out our guide here [Creating an Edition](guides/sell-nft-multiple-currencies#creating-an-edition-and-nft).

### Using the thirdweb SDK

#### Mint One NFT

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Edition"} name={"mintTo"} />

#### Mint Many NFTs (Batch Mint)

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Edition"} name={"mintBatchTo"} />

#### Mint One NFT

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Edition"} name={"mintTo"} />

#### Mint Many NFTs (Batch Mint)

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Edition"} name={"mintBatchTo"} />

## Airdrop NFTs

Airdropping means you send a wallet or a list of wallets with a configurable quantity of your NFT.

### Using the dashboard

Using the thirdweb dashboard, you can upload a `.csv` file containing a list of addresses you want to airdrop NFTs to.

You can download our example `.csv` file for airdrops [here](https://thirdweb.com/airdrop.csv).

In the `.csv` file, you must specify an `address` column and a `quantity` column, representing the address you want to send the NFTs and how many you wish to send.

### Using the thirdweb SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Edition"} name={"airdrop"} />

## Viewing NFTs

Our SDKs provide helpful ways to view the NFTs in your collection.

### One NFT

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Edition"} name={"get"} />

### All NFTs

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Edition"} name={"getAll"} />

### NFTs owned by a specific wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Edition"} name={"getOwned"} />

### Amount of tokens owned by a specific wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Edition"} name={"balanceOf"} />

## Transferring NFTs

Transferring NFTs means you can send this NFT to another wallet. You must be the owner of the NFT you're trying to transfer in order for this to be successful.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Edition"} name={"transfer"} />

## Burning NFTs

Burning is the process of removing the token from circulation by sending it to an inaccessible address. It does **not** delete the token from the blockchain.

### Using the dashboard

### Using the SDK
