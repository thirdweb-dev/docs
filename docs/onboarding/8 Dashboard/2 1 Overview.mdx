# Dashboard

The [Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) is a central place for you to create, manage, and interact with your smart contracts.

It allows you to deploy all of our [prebuilt contracts](/pre-built-contracts) to any of our [supported networks](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/which-network-should-you-use),
and perform the most important operations on them, such as lazy-minting batches of NFTs, and viewing which NFTs have been minted so far.

Once you or your team member has deployed a contract, you can fine-tune its behavior
by editing its configuration such as its metadata, royalty fees, and permission controls.

## Unlocking Dashboard Features

For each contract you deploy using the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) or the [CLI](/cli),
you unlock features in the dashboard for each [extension](/solidity/extensions) you implemented in your contract.

All prebuilt contracts come with a set of default features, including:

- [Contract Explorer](/dashboard/view-and-interact-with-contracts)
- [Contract Metadata & Fees](/dashboard/contract-settings)
- [Permission Controls](/dashboard/permission-controls)
- [Activity Feed](/dashboard/activity-feed)
