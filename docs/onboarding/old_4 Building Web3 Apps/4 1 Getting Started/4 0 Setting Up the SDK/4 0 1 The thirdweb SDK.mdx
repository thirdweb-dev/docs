      Our SDKs enable you to build web3 applications, with capabilities such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Connecting to user's wallets</li>
      <li>Deploying and interacting with smart contracts</li>
      <li>Uploading and resolving metadata from IPFS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We support the most popular languages <i>(and are working on more)</i> to
      make it easier for you to build different kinds of applications.
    </p>

## Using the SDK

Depending on the type of application you want to build, we've separated the getting started
flow into two pages.

1. [Frontend Applications](/building-web3-apps/setting-up-the-sdk/frontend): **Web-applications** that connect to user's wallets to let them interact with smart contracts.
2. [Backend & Scripting](/building-web3-apps/setting-up-the-sdk/backend): Use your own wallet to interact with smart contracts.
