# Deploy

Use the [CLI](/cli) to ship your contracts directly to the blockchain.

```bash
npx thirdweb deploy
```

Running this command will:

- **Compile** all the contracts in the current directory.
- Allow you to select which contract(s) you want to deploy.
- Upload your contract source code (ABI) to IPFS.
- Open the deploy flow in the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) for you to select one of
  our [supported networks](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/which-network-should-you-use) to deploy to.
