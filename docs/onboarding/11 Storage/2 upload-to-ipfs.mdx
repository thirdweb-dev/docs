```

### Upload Multiple Files

```

### Upload Directory

To upload an entire directory, specify the relative directory name:

```json
npx thirdweb upload directory_name
```

## Upload Files to IPFS Using JavaScript

```jsx
import { ThirdwebStorage } from "@thirdweb-dev/storage";

// First, instantiate the thirdweb IPFS storage
const storage = new ThirdwebStorage({
  secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY", // You can get one from dashboard settings
});

// Here we get the IPFS URI of where our metadata has been uploaded
const uri = await storage.upload(metadata);
// This will log a URL like ipfs://QmWgbcjKWCXhaLzMz4gNBxQpAHktQK6MkLvBkKXbsoWEEy/0
console.info(uri);

// Here we a URL with a gateway that we can look at in the browser
const url = await storage.resolveScheme(uri);
// This will log a URL like https://ipfs.thirdwebstorage.com/ipfs/QmWgbcjKWCXhaLzMz4gNBxQpAHktQK6MkLvBkKXbsoWEEy/0
console.info(url);

// You can also download the data from the uri
const data = await storage.downloadJSON(uri);
```

## Upload Files to IPFS Using React

```jsx
// Initialize your provider
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function Provider() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      clientId="YOUR_CLIENT_ID" // You can get a client id from dashboard settings
      activeChain="goerli"
      >
      ...
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}

// Upload files to IPFS
import { useStorageUpload } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const { mutateAsync: upload } = useStorageUpload();

  const uploadData = () => {
    // Get any data that you want to upload
    const dataToUpload = [...];

    // And upload the data with the upload function
    const uris = await upload({ data: dataToUpload });
  }
  ...
}

// Render files from IPFS
import { MediaRenderer } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  return (
    // Supported types: image, video, audio, 3d model, html
    <MediaRenderer src="ipfs://QmamvVM5kvsYjQJYs7x8LXKYGFkwtGvuRvqZsuzvpHmQq9/0" />
