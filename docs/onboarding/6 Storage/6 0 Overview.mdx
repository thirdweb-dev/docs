# Storage

import QuickstartCard from "@components/QuickstartCard";

Storage provides the tools necessary to easily store and access files using decentralized storage systems like [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/).

Files stored with this method are always:

- **Decentralized:** - There is no single authority that controls your files
- **Replicated:** - Your files exist in multiple different physical locations to ensure that they can't be erased
- **Censorship-Resistant:** - Files are immune to being censored or taken down

You can also opt into file **Permanence** - meaning that once you upload your files, they will be persisted forever.

**Get started by installing the Storage SDK with the following command:**

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/storage
```

## What can you do with Storage?

You can use storage for all your file storage needs, including the following:

- **NFT Media:** Store your NFT media files using decentralized storage
- **On-chain Metadata:** Store any on-chain metadata objects incluing contract metadata and other information
- **Resistant Files:** Any files that need to be resistant to censorship can be uploaded to storage
