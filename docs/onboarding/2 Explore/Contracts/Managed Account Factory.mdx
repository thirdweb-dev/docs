# Managed Account Factory

<div className="deployContractBtnContainer" style={{ marginTop: -70 }}>
  <DeployThisContractButton
    link={"https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/ManagedAccountFactory?via=portal"}
    contractType="managed-account-factory"

</div>

The **Managed Account Factory** contract is used to deploy upgradeable [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337s) smart wallets with role based permission control.

The `ManagedAccount` smart wallet is an **upgradeable** smart contract written in the [dynamic contract pattern](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/dynamic-contracts).

App developers can issue `ManagedAccount` smart wallets programmatically by deploying a `ManagedAccountFactory` smart contract.

The admin of the `ManagedAccountFactory` contract can push upgrades to all `ManagedAccounts` that it creates. This admin does not require any permissions on the `ManagedAccount` smart wallets to do so.
An upgrade to the features of `ManagedAccount` applies to all `ManagedAccount` smart wallets created by the factory.
This is the right wallet for developers who anticipate pushing upgrades to their users' wallets.

thirdweb's smart wallets have the following features by default:

- Have multiple signers with different permissions
- Execute transactions (single and batched).
- Send and receive native tokens.
- Send and receive ERC-721 and ERC-1155 NFTs.
- Multicall-able.
- Store contract metadata.

## Extensions

This contract includes the following extensions:

- [Permissions](/solidity/extensions/permissions)
- [PermissionsEnumerable](/solidity/extensions/permissionsenumerable)
- [ContractMetadata](/solidity/extensions/contractmetadata)
- [AccountFactory](/solidity/extensions/base-account-factory)
- [DynamicContract](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/dynamic-contracts)

## Use Cases & Examples

Use the `ManagedAccountFactory` contract alongside the [`SmartWallet`](/wallet/smart-wallet) connector or [`ConnectWallet`](/react/react.connectwallet) to easily use account abstraction in your projects:

### Connect Wallet

```tsx
import {
  smartWallet,
  metamaskWallet,
  coinbaseWallet,
  walletConnect,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const config = {
  factoryAddress: "0x...",
  gasless: true,
}

<ThirdwebProvider
  supportedWallets={[
    smartWallet(metamaskWallet(), config),
    smartWallet(coinbaseWallet(), config),
    smartWallet(walletConnect(), config),
  ]}
  clientId="your-client-id"
>
  <YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

```tsx
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// render ConnectWallet button wherever you want

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ConnectWallet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### TypeScript

```tsx
import { LocalWallet, SmartWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
import { Goerli } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

// First, connect the personal wallet, which can be any wallet (metamask, walletconnect, etc.)
// Here we're just generating a new local wallet which can be saved later
const personalWallet = new LocalWallet();
await personalWallet.generate();

// Setup the Smart Wallet configuration
const config: SmartWalletConfig = {
  chain: Goerli, // the chain where your smart wallet will be or is deployed
  factoryAddress: "{{factory_address}}", // your own deployed account factory address
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", // Use client id if using on the client side, get it from dashboard settings
  secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY", // Use secret key if using on the server, get it from dashboard settings
  gasless: true, // enable or disable gasless transactions
};

// Then, connect the Smart wallet
const wallet = new SmartWallet(config);
await wallet.connect({
  personalWallet,
});

// You can then use this wallet to perform transactions via the SDK
const sdk = await ThirdwebSDK.fromWallet(wallet, Goerli);
```
