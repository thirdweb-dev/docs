# Pack

<p>
The pack contract lets you bundle <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">ERC20</a>,
 <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">ERC721</a> and,
 <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155">ERC1155</a> tokens together into <b>ERC1155 NFTs</b> that act as randomized loot boxes.
</p>

The packs are ERC1155 NFTs themselves, which can have the metadata you'd expect of an NFT,
such as a name, image, description, etc.

When a pack is opened, a pre-defined quantity of tokens are randomly selected from the ones
that were used to create the packs _(that haven't already been selected)_, and awarded to the opener.
The pack NFT is burned as it's opened.

You can configure how many tokens get selected for the pack:

- How many tokens are in each "unit" (for ERC20 & ERC1155 tokens - one unit could be multiple tokens).
- How many units are in each pack.

> **IMPORTANT**: _Pack functions, such as opening of packs, can be costly in terms of gas usage due to random selection of rewards. Please check your gas estimates/usage, and do a trial on testnets before any mainnet deployment._

## Use Cases & Examples

You could use the Pack contract to:

- Create randomized NFT loot boxes
- Run a randomized raffle where some users open a winning ticket
- Reward your community with token gift boxes
