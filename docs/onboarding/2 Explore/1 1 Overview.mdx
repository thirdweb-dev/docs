# Pre-Built Contracts

Pre-built contracts are written by the thirdweb team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts; each of them are:

- [Open source](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts) and free to deploy (excl. gas fees)
- [Audited](https://bafybeid3zrwibivvrijgggpn4kc44htb4rgs6xn26er3iqkyn3tvbmtnda.gateway.ipfscdn.io/) and supported by our [bug bounty program](https://thirdweb.notion.site/thirdweb-Bug-Bounty-Program-f78d1db776ab4f0e974c9da176fcf706)
- Fully owned by the contract deployer _(you)_
- 10x cheaper to deploy than traditional contracts
