# Permissions

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/Permissions.sol";
```

The `Permissions` extension provides role-based access control: you can create roles and write custom logic in your smart contract that depends on whether a given wallet holds a given role.

There are two different contracts you can implement to add permissions:

- `Permissions`: Create roles and restrict access to functions based on those roles.
- [`PermissionsEnumerable`](/solidity/extensions/permissionsenumerable): `Permissions` plus the capability to view all the addresses holding a specific role (or all roles).

You only need to implement **one** of the two.

## Usage

This is an example smart contract demonstrating how to inherit from this extension and override the functions to add (optional) custom functionality.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/Permissions.sol";

contract MyContract is Permissions {
    // Any `bytes32` value is a valid role. You can create roles by defining them like this.
    bytes32 public constant NUMBER_ROLE = keccak256("NUMBER_ROLE");

    // See comments for `setNumber`, below.
    uint256 public number;

    /**
     *  The `Permissions` contract makes an already defined role available: the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
     *
     *  As an EXAMPLE, we grant the deployer of the contract this admin role.
     */
    constructor() {
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }

    /**
     *  EXAMPLE: here we have a function that we want to restrict only to holders of `NUMBER_ROLE`.
     *
     *  To accomplish this, we use the `onlyRole` modifier made available by `Permissions`, and
     *  pass it `NUMBER_ROLE` as an argument.
     */
    function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public onlyRole(NUMBER_ROLE) {
        number = _newNumber;
    }
}
```

## SDK Usage

## Full API Reference

<details>
<summary>hasRole</summary>
<div>

```solidity
function hasRole(bytes32 role, address account) external view returns (bool);
```

- Returns `true` if `account` has been granted `role`.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>getRoleAdmin</summary>
<div>

```solidity
function getRoleAdmin(bytes32 role) external view returns (bytes32);
```

- Returns the admin role that controls `role` i.e. the holders of the admin role (the return value) can grant or revoke `role` from wallets.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>grantRole</summary>
<div>

```solidity
function grantRole(bytes32 role, address account) external;
```

- Grants `role` to `account`. Can only be called by a holder of the admin role of the role being granted.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>revokeRole</summary>
<div>

```solidity
function revokeRole(bytes32 role, address account) external;
```

- Revokes `role` from `account`. Can only be called by a holder of the admin role of the role being granted.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>renounceRole</summary>
<div>

```solidity
function renounceRole(bytes32 role, address account) external;
```

- Revokes `role` from the calling account.

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>hasRoleWithSwitch</summary>
<div>

```solidity
function hasRoleWithSwitch(bytes32 role, address account) public view returns (bool);
```

- Returns `true` if `account` has been granted `role`.
- Role restrictions can be switched on and off:
  - If `address(0)` has `role`, then the role restrictions don't apply i.e. this function will always return `true`.
  - If `address(0)` does not have `role`, then the role restrictions will apply i.e. this function will behave like `hasRole`.
