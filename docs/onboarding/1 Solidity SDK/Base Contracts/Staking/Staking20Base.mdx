# Staking ERC20 Base

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/Staking20Base.sol";
```

The `Staking20Base` smart contract implements ERC20 token staking mechanism. It creates a composition of two ERC20 token contracts into a staking mechanism.

The base contract provides an implementation of staking logic. Contract admins can implement their own reward mechanisms by overriding existing functions.

## Usage

Import the contract and inherit from it.

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/Staking20Base.sol";

contract MyContract is Staking20Base {
    constructor(
        address _defaultAdmin,
        uint256 _timeUnit,
        uint256 _rewardRatioNumerator,
        uint256 _rewardRatioDenominator,
        address _stakingToken,
        address _rewardToken,
        address _nativeTokenWrapper
    )
        Staking20Base(
            _defaultAdmin,
            _timeUnit,
            _rewardRatioNumerator,
            _rewardRatioDenominator,
            _stakingToken,
            _rewardToken,
            _nativeTokenWrapper
        )
    {}
}
```

## Functions to Override

The following functions have been implemented on this contract & are available to be overridden to add custom logic:

<details>
<summary>_mintRewards</summary>
<div>

```solidity
    /**
     *  @dev    Mint ERC20 rewards to the staker. Must override.
     *
     *  @param _staker    Address for which to calculated rewards.
     *  @param _rewards   Amount of tokens to be given out as reward.
     *
     */
    function _mintRewards(address _staker, uint256 _rewards) internal virtual override {
        // Mint or transfer reward-tokens here.
        // e.g.
        //
        // IERC20(rewardToken).transfer(_staker, _rewards);
        //
        // OR
        //
        // Use a mintable ERC20, such as thirdweb's `TokenERC20.sol`
        //
        // TokenERC20(rewardToken).mintTo(_staker, _rewards);
        // note: The staking contract should have minter role to mint tokens.
    }
```
