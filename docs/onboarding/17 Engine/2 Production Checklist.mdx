Follow best practices when using Engine in a production environment.

### Security

- Do _not_ set the environment variable `ENABLE_HTTPS=true`.
- Securely store access tokens and the thirdweb secret key. Rotate these credentials if they are compromised.
- Use labels to keep track of your wallets, admins, and access tokens.
- Use access token with expirations to grant time-bound access.
- Regularly review the admins list to remove inactive and former team members.

### Cloud hosting

- Host Engine Docker on a cloud provider.
  - Minimum specs: 1 vCPU, 2 GB memory (AWS equivalent: t2.small)
  - Autoscale the instance count to increase inbound throughput and queuing capacity.
- Host Postgres DB on a cloud provider.
  - Examples: [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/), [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/postgres), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview)
  - Minimum specs: 2 vCPU, 2 GB memory (AWS equivalent: t4g.small)

### Backend wallets

- Recommended: Use a wallet backed by AWS KMS or Google KMS. Wallet access is always recoverable and private keys are never exposed.
- If using a local wallet: **back up the private key**. Engine cannot recover private keys if the encrypted stored data is lost or corrupted.
- Ensure your backend wallets have sufficient funds. Consider using [wallet webhooks](/engine/webhooks) to alert when your native coin balance is low.
