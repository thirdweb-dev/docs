Engine makes it effortless for any developer to airdrop NFTs at scale. You sponsor the gas so your users only need a wallet address!

> This guide references Polygon Mumbai testnet and NextJS but is applicable for any EVM chain and full-stack framework.

## Prerequisites

- An Engine instance
- A [backend wallet](/engine/backend-wallets) with [MATIC on Mumbai](https://mumbaifaucet.com/)
- A deployed NFT contract that can be claimed by the backend wallet
- A client ID and secret key from the [API Keys page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys)

## Frontend: Add Connect Wallet and Claim buttons

Use [`<ConnectWallet>`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/react.connectwallet) to prompt the user for their wallet. The **Claim** button calls `POST /api/claim`.

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider activeChain="mumbai" clientId="<thirdweb_client_id>">
      <ClaimPage />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}

function ClaimPage() {
  const userWalletAddress = useAddress();

  const onClick = async () => {
    await fetch("/api/claim", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({ userWalletAddress }),
    });
    alert(`🎉 A reward has been sent to your wallet: ${userWalletAddress}`);
  };

  return (
    <main>
      <h2>Thank you for being a superfan! ❤️</h2>
      <ConnectWallet />
      {userWalletAddress && <button onClick={onClick}>Claim my reward</button>}
    </main>
  );
}
```

_Replace `<thirdweb_client_id>`_.

## Backend: Call Engine to mint an NFT

`POST /api/claim` calls Engine to mint an NFT to the user's wallet.

```tsx
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { userWalletAddress } = await request.json();

  await fetch(
    "<engine_url>/contract/mumbai/<nft_contract_address>/erc1155/mint-to",
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: "Bearer <thirdweb_secret_key>",
        "x-backend-wallet-address": "<backend_wallet_address>",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        receiver: userWalletAddress,
        metadataWithSupply: {
          metadata: {
            name: "Acme Inc. Superfan",
            description: "Created with thirdweb Engine",
            image:
              "ipfs://QmciR3WLJsf2BgzTSjbG5zCxsrEQ8PqsHK7JWGWsDSNo46/nft.png",
          },
          supply: "1",
        },
      }),
    },
  );

  return NextResponse.json({ message: "Success!" });
}
```

## Try it out!

Here’s what the user flow looks like.

The app prompts the user to connect their wallet.

A user presses claim.

They'll receive the NFT in their wallet shortly!
