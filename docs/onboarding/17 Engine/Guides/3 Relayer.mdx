You may want to sponsor the gas for your user's transactions using a meta-transaction relayer.

Engine allows you to create meta-transaction relayer endpoints that you can use from your client-side application.

It supports the following standard meta-transaction formats:

- [EIP-2771 Native Meta-transactions](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2771)
- [EIP-2612 Permit Approval](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612)
- [Polygon Native Meta-transactions](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/pos/design/transactions/meta-transactions/meta-transactions/)

In this guide, we're going to setup a meta-transaction relayer with Engine and use it to sponsor gas fees for users' client-side transactions.

## Step 1: Create a meta-transaction relayer endpoint

First, we need to create a new meta-transaction relayer endpoint with Engine.

You can do this from the `Explorer` tab on your Engine dashboard by navigating to the `POST - /relayer/create` endpoint.

Here, you'll need to specify:

1. The `chain` your relayer will function on.
2. The `backendWalletAddress` of the Engine backend wallet you want to use to sponsor funds for your user.
3. The `allowedContracts` that the endpoint can forward transactions to.
4. Optionally, the `name` of your relayer
5. Optionally, the `allowedForwarders` the relayer is allowed to forward transactions with

Once you create the endpoint, you'll get back a `uuid` which is the unique ID of your relayer endpoint.

With this ID, you're meta-transaction relayer endpoint will be at `POST - /relayer/{relayerId}`.

## Step 2: Use your relayer endpoint to sponsor transactions

Now that we've setup our endpoint, we can use it to sponsor transactions for our users using the `@thirdweb-dev/react` package on the client-side.

All we need to do is setup the SDK to be aware of our meta-transaction relayer endpoint using the `ThirdwebProvider`, and it will attempt to send all transactions through the endpoint.

In the following snippet, we setup the `ThirdwebProvider`, and additionally specify the `sdkOptions.gasless.engine.relayerUrl` parameter to enable meta-transaction relaying.

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      activeChain="polygon"
      sdkOptions={{
        gasless: {
          engine: {
            // Here we specify our engine relayer URL that we created earlier
            relayerUrl:
              "http://0.0.0.0:3005/relayer/4cc2b996-27dd-4263-a9ab-0997905c5e29",
          },
        },
      }}
    >
      <Component />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

And we'll need to add a `ConnectWallet` button into our app to allow our user's to connect their wallets - this button is highly customizable, for more you can read into the [details of using the ConnectWallet button](https://portal.thirdweb.com/connect).

```tsx
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export function Connect() {
  return <ConnectWallet />;
}
```

Now, when we send a transaction to a contract from the user's connected wallet, it will be forwarded through our meta-transaction relayer and sponsored by the Engine backend wallet instead of forcing the user to spend funds.

```tsx
import { useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Component() {
  const contract = useContract("0x7A0CE8524bea337f0beE853B68fAbDE145dAC0A0");

  const mint = async () => {
    // This mint transaction will automatically use the engine relayer
    await contract.erc20.mint(1);
  };

  return <Button onClick={mint}>Approve</Button>;
}
```

Using this simple flow, you can use Engine as a meta-transaction relayer to sponsor funds for your users!

The last point to note - the SDK and Engine will automatically detect what type of meta-transaction method (EIP-2771, EIP-2612, etc.) is appropriate to use based on your contract, and will handle the details under the hood.
