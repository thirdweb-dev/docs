title: 3. Go Live Checklist
---

Before you go live on mainnet, be sure to review this checklist to ensure your production checkout launch goes smoothly.

## 3.1 Test your expected flow works on testnet

Testing on mainnet is costly! Please test your contract and checkout implementation on testnet.

- For Polygon projects, please test on Mumbai.
- For Ethereum projects, please test on Sepolia.
- Visit the [overview page](/checkouts) to see a list of supported testnets.

You should be able to test all critical aspects of your smart contract on testnet, including allowlists, signature-based mints, your custom mint method, etc.

## 3.2 Provide personal and business information

In order to accept fiat payments (credit cards, debit cards) on mainnet chains, we are required by law to verify your personal (KYC) and business (KYB) information. This information is collected purely for compliance purposes and is not used or shared for any other reason. **You must provide this information at least 48 hours prior to launch.**

## 3.3 Set up production webhook endpoints

Testnet and mainnet transactions call a different set of webhook endpoints. Make sure to add your production endpoint(s) in the Webhooks section of the dashboard before going live.

## 3.4 Ensure your NFT is priced under $2,000 USD

We currently limit checkouts to be priced under $2,000 USD by default. We may be able to change this at our discretion based on your checkout's risk profile.

To request a higher price limit, please contact support@thirdweb.com.

## 3.5 Inform us of high volume launches

If you are expecting very high sales volume, please reach out in Discord in advance so we can make sure the engineering team is aware and ready to support your launch.

## 3.6 Change ERC-20 addresses (if applicable)

Remember that ERC-20 token addresses differ between testnet and mainnet. Make sure to update your contract to point at the mainnet address for the requested token.

## 3.7 Verify your collection on OpenSea

If your contract is on an L2 chain like Polygon, OpenSea may hide your collection by default from buyers' profiles. To avoid this, please contact OpenSea to verify your collection before your launch.

Buyers are still able to complete their purchase regardless of OpenSea verification, but may need to manually unhide their purchased token from their OpenSea profile if it is hidden by default.
