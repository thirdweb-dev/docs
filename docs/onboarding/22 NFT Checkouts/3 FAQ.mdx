## General

### How much does thirdweb Checkouts cost?

There is **no cost to sellers**! Buyers pay a 1% service fee on top of payment processing fees.

### How long does implementation take?

A full-featured checkout link **takes minutes to set up**:

1. [Register your contract](enable-contract).
2. Create a [🔗 Checkout Link](checkout-link).
3. Send the link to your customers. Done ✨!

When you're ready to customize further, you can tinker with styling, SDKs, webhooks, dynamic pricing, and more.

### How scalable is thirdweb Checkouts? How much load can it handle?

Our product is enterprise-ready with a 99.9% uptime. We are battle-tested with enterprises like Balmain, New York Fashion Week, Unilever, deadmau5 and Tilting Point. We can enqueue transactions up to 200 transactions/minute by default, with higher limits upon request.

### What platforms are supported?

Checkout links can be used anywhere webpages are supported.

The Checkout Embedded Elements SDK is supported on Web and Mobile Web.

## Smart contract support

### Which blockchains and currencies are supported?

See the [overview](/checkouts) page for a list of supported chains and currencies. We can support any EVM chain upon request. Please contact support@thirdweb.com if the chain or currency you want to sell in is not on our list.

### Are marketplace contracts supported?

Yes! See [Marketplace Sales](marketplaces) for more details.

### Can I sell an NFT that is already minted?

Yes! You'll need to "wrap" your NFT with a marketplace contract like [thirdweb marketplace](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/marketplace) or build your own. This "direct listing" approach works like this:

- The seller has an NFT already minted and wants to sell it.
- The seller approves the marketplace contract to take this NFT from their wallet once a buyer offers a specified amount. The NFT is not moved until a sale is completed.
- A buyer agrees to pay the specified amount. They pay via your Checkout flow.
- After the buyer's payment is successful, thirdweb calls the "buy" method with the expected amount in crypto to the marketplace contract. This method transfers the NFT to the buyer's wallet.

## Payments

### Where does thirdweb send the funds after a customer has paid?

thirdweb directly calls the smart contract and pays for the mint using the native currency specified in the contract function. If you are looking for FIAT payout, it is available for the enterprise customers. Please [contact sales](mailto:sales@thirdweb.com) .

### What regions does thirdweb support credit card payments?

thirdweb uses multiple payment processors and supports credit card payments in most countries (190+) and all 50 US states. Select countries that the US cannot conduct business with are not supported (Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk Regions). 10+ currencies and languages are supported.

### What fiat payment options are accepted?

thirdweb accepts: credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, UnionPay, JCB, Diners Club), Apple Pay, Google Pay, iDEAL

### What is the price limit for checkouts?

thirdweb limits checkouts to be priced at $2,000 USD and reserves the right to change this limit based on your checkout's risk profile. For enterprise customers, we can support up to $15,000.

If you need a higher price limit, please fill out [this form](https://thirdweb.com/contact-us).

### Do you support gasless transactions?

Yes, we support the ability for merchants to cover the gas fees related to transactions. See the guide on [Sponsored Fees](sponsored-fees).

### When does thirdweb require identity verification (KYC)?

thirdweb combines buyer, merchant, payment method, device, and behavioral signals from multiple vendors to compute the riskiness of a purchase. A small portion of buyers (\< 3% and varies by merchant) will be prompted to submit a photo ID and take a webcam selfie. This step is automated and takes under 1 minute.

Reminder: thirdweb takes on **all** chargeback liability from the developer!

### How do allow my users to redeem utility with their NFT?

NFTs are a great way to gate content! Once the NFT is purchased, you can provide a link to redeem their utility on the post-purchase page and email.

Listen to [webhooks](webhooks) to update your database or send a custom email when the NFT has been transferred.

### How do I customize the emails sent to buyers?

See the [Email Customization](email-customization) guide.

Buyers who don't have a wallet can create one with their email or social login. This uses thirdweb's non-custodial [Embedded Wallet](https://portal.thirdweb.com/embedded-wallet) product.

### How does my user transfer the NFT from the Embedded Wallet?
