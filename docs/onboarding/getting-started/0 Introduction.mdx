# Get Started

<div className="heroGrid">

    <p>
In this getting started guide, we'll show you how to build and deploy a full web3 application!
</p>

By the end, you'll have a [finished project](https://replit.com/@thirdweb/getting-started) that allows
you to mint NFTs into an ERC721A smart contract that you created and deployed on the Ethereum test network!

Let's get started by [building a contract](/getting-started/creating-custom-contracts)!
