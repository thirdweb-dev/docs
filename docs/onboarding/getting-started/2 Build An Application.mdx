# Create An Application

You just [built and deployed](/getting-started/creating-custom-contracts) a smart contract to the blockchain. Congratulations!

Now, let's see how we can build an application that interacts with it.

## Creating A Project

Run the following command to create a web application with the [React](/react) and [JavaScript](/typescript) SDKs installed for us.

```bash
npx thirdweb create --app
```

Select `Next.js` as the framework and `JavaScript` as the language.

![thirdweb CLI - thirdweb create --app](./assets/5.png)

Open up the project in your text editor - let's see what we're working with!

### Exploring the project

Inside the [`_app.jsx`](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/next-javascript-starter/blob/main/pages/_app.js#L8-L10) file,
you'll find the [`ThirdwebProvider`](/sdk/set-up-the-sdk/frontend#manual-installation) wrapping the entire application.

This allows us to use all of the [React SDK](/react) hooks and components in our application, and configure a `desiredChainId`;
which declares [which blockchain & network](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/which-network-should-you-use/) our smart contracts live on.

Since we deployed our smart contract to the `Goerli` network, we'll set the `desiredChainId` to `ChainId.Goerli`.

```jsx title="pages/_app.jsx"
import { ThirdwebProvider, ChainId } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Here we can specify the chainId our app should run on
// In this example, we'll use the Ethereum Goerli Testnet
const desiredChainId = ChainId.Goerli;

export const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={desiredChainId}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

On the [`index.jsx`](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/next-javascript-starter/blob/main/pages/index.js#L5) page,
you'll find a [Connect Wallet button](/sdk/ui-components/connectwalletbutton) that allows users to connect their wallet to our application.

```jsx title="pages/index.jsx"
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  return <ConnectWallet accentColor="#f213a4" colorMode="light" />;
}
```

## Building the App

Now that we have a project set up, let's start interacting with our smart contract.

### Connecting to the Contract

To do that, we'll need our contract address; which you can get from the dashboard:

![Copy address to clipboard](./assets/7.png)

Then, pass that value into the [`useContract`](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/custom-contracts/getting-a-contract#connect-to-a-contract)
hook like so:

```jsx title="pages/index.jsx"
import { useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { contract } = useContract("<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>");

  // Now you can use the contract in the rest of the component!
}
```

### Reading Data

The [`useContractRead`](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/custom-contracts/using-contracts) hook
lets you read any data from your smart contract using the `contract` as the first parameter, and the name of the
function/view/mapping, etc. as the second parameter.

For example, we can read the `name` value stored in our contract like so:

```jsx title="pages/index.jsx"
import { useContract, useContractRead } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { contract } = useContract("<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>");
  const { data: name, isLoading } = useContractRead(contract, "name");
}
```

:::tip Understanding the Syntax

Learn more about these ES6 JavaScript features used above - [destructuring and renaming](https://wesbos.com/destructuring-renaming).

:::

Sometimes, using `useContractRead` doesn't give you all the information you need.

For example, to view all of the NFTs in our contract using this method, we'd need to:

- Read the total number of tokens in the contract
- Loop through each token ID and read the URI for each one
- Fetch each NFT's metadata from IPFS using a gateway
- Query each NFT for its current owner

That's a lot of work. Now's a good time to introduce our **specialized functions** 🦸!

### Solidity Extension -> JavaScript Function

For each of the [extensions](/contractkit/features) you implemented in your smart contract,
you unlock a way to use that in your application.

Let's look at an example. The contract we built implements the [ERC721](/contractkit/erc721)
and [ERC721Supply](/contractkit/erc721supply) extensions.

By doing so, we can use the [View All](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/erc721supply)
functionality in our application! In React, that is the [`useNFTs`](/react/react.usenfts) hook:

```jsx title="pages/index.jsx"
import { useContract, useNFTs } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { contract } = useContract("<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>");
  const { data: nfts, isLoading: isReadingNfts } = useNFTs(contract);
}
```

Under the hood, this does all of the heavy lifting we mentioned above, and more!

By using the `useNFTs` hook, here's what we get:

- All of the NFTs in our contract with their metadata and current owner
- An `isLoading` state you can use to show a loading indicator
- **Cached** results - so you don't have to worry about re-fetching the same data again
- **Real-time** updates - so you can see the latest data as it changes (if you use [`Web3Button`](/sdk/ui-components/web3button) or our write-hooks)
- An `isError` flag, pagination options, automatic retries, and more!

:::tip React Query

Our React SDK uses a library called [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/) to power these features.

:::

Now that we have a query to get all of our NFTs, let's mint one and display them in our app!

### Writing Transactions

You can call any function on your smart contract with the
[`useContractWrite`](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/custom-contracts/using-contracts) hook, but for most use cases,
you'll want to use the [`Web3Button`](/sdk/ui-components/web3button) component to write transactions; which ensures the user
has their wallet connected and is on the right network before calling the function.

As we described above, you also gain access to a specialized function for each extension you implement in Solidity,
such as the [Mint](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/erc721mintable) feature enabled by
implementing [ERC721Mintable](/contractkit/erc721mintable#unlocked-features) in our smart contract.

Now we know how to read and write to our smart contract, let's build the UI for our app! 💅

### UI Components

Let's render each of the NFTs using the [`NFT Media Renderer`](/sdk/ui-components/nft-renderer)
component, making use of the loading state from `useNFTs`:

```jsx title="pages/index.jsx"
import {
  useContract,
  useNFTs,
  useMintNFT,
  ThirdwebNftMedia,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { contract } = useContract("<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>");
  const { data: nfts, isLoading: isReadingNfts } = useNFTs(contract);
  const { mutate: mintNFT, isLoading: isMintingNFT } = useMintNFT(contract);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>My NFTs</h2>
      {isReadingNfts ? (
        <p>Loading...</p>
      ) : (
        <div>
          {nfts.map((nft) => (
            <ThirdwebNftMedia
              key={nft.tokenId}
              metadata={nft.metadata}
              height={200}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Next, let's add a button to mint an NFT, using the [`Web3Button`](/sdk/ui-components/web3button) component:

```jsx title="pages/index.jsx"
import {
  useContract,
  useNFTs,
  ThirdwebNftMedia,
  Web3Button,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const contractAddress = "<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>";
export default function Home() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data: nfts, isLoading: isReadingNfts } = useNFTs(contract);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... Existing Display Logic here ... */}

      <Web3Button
        contractAddress={contractAddress}
        action={(contract) =>
          contract.erc721.mint({
            name: "Hello world!",
            image:
              // You can use a file or URL here!
              "ipfs://QmZbovNXznTHpYn2oqgCFQYP4ZCpKDquenv5rFCX8irseo/0.png",
          })
        }
      >
        Mint NFT
      </Web3Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's it! You've built a full web3 app! 🎉 With only a few lines of code, your app can:

- View all of the NFTs in your contract with live updates
- Mint new NFTs using your wallet
