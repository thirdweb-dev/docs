# Connecting to a Wallet

The SDK offers functions that allow you to let users connect their wallet to your app, and view information about their wallet such as their wallet address and token balance.

:::info Wallet Connection

These features are only available in our [React](/react) SDK.

If you are looking to connect to the SDK via your private key or via a signer object, use the [Backend & Scripting Applications](/building-web3-apps/setting-up-the-sdk/backend) page.

:::

To use a wallet connection hook, your app needs to be wrapped in the [ThirdwebProvider](/building-web3-apps/setting-up-the-sdk/frontend#manual-installation) component.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, ChainId } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const desiredChainId = ChainId.Mumbai;

export const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={desiredChainId}>
      {/*
          Your App Goes Here
      */}
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

Then, connect to the wallet using one of our [wallet connection hooks](/react/category/wallet-connection) such as [useMetamask](/react/react.usemetamask), and
view the connected wallet address using [useAddress](/react/react.useaddress).

Below is an example of a React component that shows users a button to connect their wallet using MetaMask, then shows the connected wallet address once they have connected.

```jsx
import { useAddress, useDisconnect, useMetamask } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export const ConnectMetamaskButtonComponent = () => {
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();
  const address = useAddress();
  return (
    <div>
      {address ? (
        <h4>Connected as {address}</h4>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={connectWithMetamask}>Connect Metamask Wallet</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```
