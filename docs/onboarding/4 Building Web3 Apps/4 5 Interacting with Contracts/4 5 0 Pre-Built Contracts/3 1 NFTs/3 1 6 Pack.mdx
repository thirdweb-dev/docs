# Pack

The pack contract lets you bundle
[ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20),
[ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and,
[ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) tokens together into **ERC-1155 NFTs** that act as randomized loot boxes.

When a pack is opened, a pre-defined quantity of tokens are randomly selected from the ones
that were used to create the packs _(that haven't already been selected)_, and awarded to the opener.
The pack NFT is burned as it's opened.

You can configure how many tokens get selected for the pack:

- How many tokens are in each "unit" (for ERC-20 & ERC-1155 tokens - one unit could be multiple tokens).
- How many units are in each pack.

<br />

You could use the Pack contract to:

- Create randomized NFT loot boxes

- Run a randomized raffle where some users open a winning ticket

- Reward your community with token gift boxes

## Create a Pack Contract

_Currently, you can only deploy a Pack contract from the thirdweb SDK._

_Support for Pack dashboard deployments is coming soon._

<!-- Learn how to create any of thirdweb's pre-built contracts via the [Deploying Contracts page](/getting-started/deploying-contracts). -->

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"ContractDeployer"} name={"deployPack"} />

## Getting the contract in your application

To start using your Pack contract inside your application, you need to use its contract address.

You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet
  contract={"Pack"}
  name={"initializing the SDK"}
  isGetContractCode
/>

## Setting Royalty Fees

Royalty fees are fees you earn on secondary sales of your NFTs.

For example, if you sell an NFT on the marketplace, and it is then sold again to another user, you will earn a royalty fee.

Since each pack is an NFT itself, royalty fees get paid on these secondary sales.

### Using the dashboard

From the dashboard, in the **Settings** tab, you can set the royalty **percentage** and the **address** that should receive the revenue from royalties earned from secondary sales of the assets.

### Using the thirdweb SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Pack"} name={"royalties"} />

## Create a Pack

You can bundle any number of ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155 tokens into a set quantity of ERC-1155 pack NFTs.

When you create a pack, it is minted as a new NFT in the smart contract.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Pack"} name={"createTo"} />

## Airdrop a Pack

Airdropping means you send a wallet or a list of wallets a configurable quantity of your NFT (pack).

### Using the dashboard

Using the thirdweb dashboard, you can upload a `.csv` file containing a list of addresses you want to airdrop NFTs to.

You can download our example `.csv` file for airdrops [here](https://thirdweb.com/airdrop.csv).

In the `.csv` file, you must specify an `address` column and a `quantity` column, representing the address you want to send the NFTs and how many you wish to send.

### Using the thirdweb SDK

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Pack"} name={"airdrop"} />

## View Packs

### One

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Pack"} name={"get"} />

### All

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Pack"} name={"getAll"} />

### Owned by a specific wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Pack"} name={"getOwned"} />

### Amount owned by a specific wallet

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Pack"} name={"balanceOf"} />

## View Pack Contents

You can view all of the rewards that were bundled to create the packs, but not the contents of each individual pack.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Pack"} name={"getPackContents"} />

## Open Pack

When you open a pack, you receive the tokens within it and **burn** the pack NFT.

Only the owner of a pack can open it.

Multiple of the same pack can be opened at once.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Pack"} name={"open"} />

## Transferring NFTs

Transferring allows you to send this pack to another wallet.

You must be the owner of the pack you're trying to transfer for this to be successful.

<ThirdwebCodeSnippet contract={"Pack"} name={"transfer"} />
