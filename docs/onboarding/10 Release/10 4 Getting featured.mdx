### Best practices

Releases that follow these guidelines have a higher chance of getting featured on the <a href="https://thirdweb.com/explore">Explore page</a>. These improve the experience for people deploying your released contract.

- The name and description of your contract should be clear & concise.
- Add an image for your contract. 
- Release your contract from your public account, preferrably one that is linked to an ENS. Update your account's name, description, and image. 
- Write a comprehensive README that educates users on what your contract does, how it works, and how to deploy it.
- Add display names, default values and directive descriptions for your contract parameters. This makes it easy for users to deploy your contract.
- In the case of proxy and factory contracts, make it available on as many networks as possible.
- Link to your contract's audit report. Audited contracts have a higher chance of getting featured.
