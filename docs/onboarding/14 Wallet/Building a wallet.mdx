The `@thirdweb-dev/wallets` package provides a set of pre-built components and functionality for creating and managing cryptocurrency wallets.

The following will guide you through how you can create your own wallet in a few simple steps:

1. Implement your own `Connector` class
2. Implement your own `AbstractBrowserWallet` class
3. Integrate with Connect Wallet button in React/React Native

At the end of this guide you should have a fully functional wallet that can be used with the thirdweb TS, React and React Native SDKs.

## 1. Extending the `Connector` class

The [`Connector`](/wallet/interfaces/connector) abstract class is the
interface between your wallet core functionality and the actual wallet class you'll use in your application.

This is the biggest part of the wallet implementation and allows to bridge any wallet provider to a standardized interface.

### Interface

```javascript
export class MyConnector extends Connector {
  connect(args?: ConnectParams<TConnectParams>): Promise<string>
  disconnect(): Promise<void>
  getAddress(): Promise<string>
  getSigner(): Promise<Signer>
  getProvider(): Promise<providers.Provider>
  switchChain(chainId: number): Promise<void>
  isConnected(): Promise<boolean>
  setupListeners(): Promise<void>
  updateChains(chains: Chain[]): void
}
```

You can choose to implement all or part of the connector functionality.

### Required methods

##### connect

This method should trigger the connection flow of your wallet with the user's app.

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### args

The arguments needed to connect your wallet. This is specific to your wallet implementation which is why we leave it open for you to
add custom arguments here.

Returns a `string` containing the wallet address, or `undefined` if the connection failed.

```typescript
abstract connect(args?: ConnectParams<TConnectParams>): Promise<string>;

ConnectParams<TOpts extends Record<string, any> = {}> = {
  chainId?: number;
} & TOpts;
```

</div>
</details>

##### getSigner

Returns a `Promise<Signer>` with the ethers signer associated with your wallet.

##### getProvider

Returns a `Promise<providers.Provider>` with the ethers provider associated with your wallet.

##### disconnect

Disconnect the currently connected wallet from your app.

##### isConnected

Returns a `Promise<boolean>` indicating whether the wallet is connected or not.

##### getAddress

Returns a `Promise<string>` with the currently connected wallet address.

### Optional methods

You can throw an exception or leave the implementation empty if you don't want to implement these methods.

##### switchChain

Switch the chain the wallet is connected to.

##### setupListeners

This method should set all listeners needed for the wallet to work. It will be used by the `AbstractClientWallet` class to setup the listeners
when the wallet is connected.

##### updateChains

Update the chains the wallet can connect to.

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### chains

The chains that are supported by the wallet. Defaults to our default chains.

Must be an array of `Chain` objects.

```typescript
type Chain = {
  chainId: number;
  chainName: string;
  nativeCurrency: {
    name: string;
    symbol: string;
    decimals: number;
  };
  rpcUrls: string[];
  blockExplorerUrls: string[];
};
```

</div>
</details>

<br />

## 2. Extending the `AbstractClientWallet` class

Now that the hard part is done, the rest is easy, we just need to wrap our connector in a `AbstractClientWallet` class.

The [`AbstractClientWallet`](/wallet/interface/abstract-client-wallet) class is the base
class that provides an interface for interacting with your connector on one side and with applications on the other.

The main method that needs to be overridden is the `getConnector` method. This method should return a `Promise`
that resolves to a the [`Connector`](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/wallets/src/evm/interfaces/connector.ts#L6)
class that you implemented.

```javascript
export class MyWallet extends AbstractClientWallet {
  async getConnector(): Promise<Connector> {
    return new MyConnector();
  }
}
```

You can add expose any custom logic here as the public API for your wallet.

## Required Methods

##### getConnector

Returns a `Promise<Connector>` with the connector class that you implemented.

## Using your new wallet

At this point you should be able to instantiate your new wallet and calling `connect` on it.

```ts
const wallet = new MyWallet();
wallet.connect();
```

## Examples

You can look at how the built-in wallets in `@thirdweb-dev/wallets` package are created for reference

- [MetaMask](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/wallets/src/evm/wallets/metamask.ts)
- [Coinbase](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/wallets/src/evm/wallets/coinbase-wallet.ts)
- [WalletConnect v1](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/wallets/src/evm/wallets/wallet-connect-v1.ts)
- [WalletConnect v2](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/wallets/src/evm/wallets/wallet-connect.ts)
- [Local Wallet](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/wallets/src/evm/wallets/local-wallet.ts)

- [Magic Link](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/wallets/src/evm/wallets/magic.ts)

<br />

## 3. Integrate with Connect Wallet button

## Create a wallet configurator function

The last step is to integrate it with [ConnectWallet](/react/react.connectwallet) by creating a wallet configurator - a function that returns a `WalletConfig` object and specifying it in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional)

```tsx
import { WalletConfig } from '@thirdweb-dev/react'

function myWallet (options?: MyWalletConfig): WalletConfig<MyWallet> {
  return {
    id: 'my-wallet',
    meta: {
      name: "My Wallet",
      iconURL: "https://...", // or ipfs://...

      // optional
      urls: {
        chrome: "https://...",
        firefox: "https://...",
        android: "https://...",
        ios: "https://...",
      },
    },

    // create and return wallet instance
    create(walletOptions) {
      return new MyWallet({ ...walletOptions, ...options })
    }

    // optional - render a UI for connecting your wallet
    connectUI(props) {
      return <MyWalletConnectionUI {...props} />;
    },

    // optional - override the default UI for selecting your wallet in wallet selector screen
    selectUI(props) {
      return <MyWalletSelectionUI {...props} />
    }

    // optional
    isInstalled() {
      // detect if your wallet extension is installed on user's browser/device
      return true; // or false
    },
  };
};
```

### Required

<details>
  <summary> id </summary>
  <div>

A unique ID for your wallet. It is used to identify your wallet among other wallets in the app.

It can be anything, but using the name of your wallet as `id` is recommended because it
is not likely to be used by other wallets.

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> meta </summary>
  <div>

metadata of your wallet.

`name` and `iconURL` are required. They are used to display your wallet in the list of supported wallets in Connect Wallet Modal's Wallet Selector screen.

<img src="/assets/connect-wallet/wallet-selector-screen.png" />

`urls` object is optional and all of its properties are optional as well.

```ts
{
  chrome?: string;
  firefox?: string;
  android?: string;
  ios?: string;
}
```

It is used to display a built-in "Get Started" screen. This screen renders UI for downloading the wallet's browser extension or iOS/Android app.

<img src="/assets/connect-wallet/get-started.png" />

"Get started" screen's link is rendered below the list of supported wallets in ConnectWallet Modal - This link is only rendered if the first wallet in [supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) array) has the `urls` object in `meta`.

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> create </summary>
  <div>

A function that creates and returns the wallet instance.

### Type

```ts
import type { WalletOptions } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
import type { WalletInstance } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

type Create = (walletOptions: WalletOptions) => WalletInstance;
```

You can create an instance of your wallet using the `walletOptions` provided by the `create` function and optionally add the `options` provided by the `myWallet` function.

```ts
create(walletOptions) {
  return new MyWallet({
    ...walletOptions,
    ...options,
  });
}
```

since the `create` method only provides `options` of type `WalletOptions` - the rest of the wallet-specific configuration (if any) can be exposed as `options` of the `myWallet` function.

</div>
</details>

### Optional

<details>
  <summary> connectUI  </summary>
  <div>

A function that returns a React component that renders the UI for connecting to your wallet.

This UI will be rendered inside the ConnectWallet Modal when the user clicks on your wallet in the list of supported wallets.

The `connectUI` function provides the props of type `ConnectUIProps` which you can use in your UI to trigger various actions - like closing the modal, opening the modal, going back to the list of supported wallets etc.

### ConnectUIProps

```ts
{
  walletConfig: WalletConfig;
  supportedWallets: WalletConfig[];
  open: () => void;
  close: (reset?: boolean) => void;
  isOpen: boolean;
  goBack: () => void;
  theme: "dark" | "light";
  selectionData: any;
  setSelectionData: (data: any) => void;
};
```

<details>
  <summary> walletConfig </summary>
  <div>

```ts
walletConfig: WalletConfig;
```

`WalletConfig` object of your wallet. You can use it for connecting your wallet and getting metadata

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> supportedWallets  </summary>
  <div>

```ts
supportedWallets: WalletConfig[];
```

List of all supported wallets including your wallet.

You can use this to conditionally render UI based on how many wallets are supported.

If only one wallet (your wallet) is supported, ConnectWallet Modal will skip showing the wallet selection screen and directly render the connectUI of your wallet.

You can detect this by checking if `supportedWallets.length === 1` and adjusting your UI accordingly - for example: not rendering a "back" button

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> open  </summary>
  <div>

```ts
open: () => void;
```

Open the ConnectWallet modal

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> close  </summary>
  <div>

```ts
close: (reset?: boolean) => void;
```

close the ConnectWallet modal.

If `close` is called with `true` ( reset = true ), the ConnectWallet modal will be reset to its initial state - so that if it's opened again, it will start from the wallet-selection screen.

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> isOpen  </summary>
  <div>

```ts
isOpen: boolean;
```

Indicates whether the connect wallet modal is open or not

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> goBack  </summary>
  <div>

```ts
goBack: () => void;
```

Go back to the wallet selector screen in ConnectWallet modal

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> theme  </summary>
  <div>

Theme of the ConnectWallet modal

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> selectionData  </summary>
  <div>

```ts
selectionData: any;
```

selectionData passed from `selectUI`'s `onSelect` function.

This is only relevant if you are using `selectUI` to render a custom UI for selecting your wallet

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> setSelectionData  </summary>
  <div>

set selectionData

This is only relevant if you are creating a `connectUI` which involves rendering other wallets and you need to render the `selectUI` of those wallets and need to pass down the `onSelect` prop.

```ts
selectionData: any;
```

selectionData passed from `selectUI`'s `onSelect` function.

This is only relevant if you are using `selectUI` to render a custom UI for selecting your wallet

</div>
</details>

<br />

### Headless Mode

If no `connectUI` is given, the wallet is assumed to be in "headless" mode - meaning that it does not require any UI to be rendered inside the ConnectWallet Modal to connect the wallet - This can be the case if either the wallet has its own UI that is appended to DOM (Example: walletConnect on web) or it does not require any UI at all.

In this case, when the user clicks on your wallet in the wallet selector screen, your wallet is connected using the `useConnect` hook and the ConnectWallet Modal is closed.

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> selectUI </summary>
  <div>

A function that returns a React component that renders the UI for selecting your wallet.

Instead of the default icon + name in wallet selector screen, you can render a custom UI for your wallet.

Take [paper wallet](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/react/src/wallet/wallets/paperWallet.tsx) for example, It renders a Input field where the user can enter their email address.

<img src="/assets/connect-wallet/paper-wallet-selection-ui.png" />

Wallets with `selectUI` are rendered at the top of the list in ConnectWallet Modal's wallet selector screen.

The `selectUI` function provides the props of type `SelectUIProps` which you can use in your UI to trigger wallet selection and move to the next screen in ConnectWallet Modal using `onSelect` and also optionally save user's input using `onSelect(data)` which will be passed to `connectUI`'s `selectionData` prop.

### SelectUIProps

```tsx
{
  /**
   * Call this function to "select" your wallet and render the screen for connecting the wallet
   * @param selectionData - selectionData to be passed to `connectUI`'s `selectionData` prop
   * @returns
   */
  onSelect: (selectionData: any) => void;

  /**
   * `WalletConfig` object of your wallet
   *
   * you can use this get metadata of your wallet by doing `walletConfig.meta`
   */
  walletConfig: WalletConfig;

  /**
   * List of all supported wallets including your wallet.
   *
   * You can use this to conditionally render UI based on how many wallets are supported.
   * For example: You can render a "OR" at the bottom of your UI if more than one wallet is supported
   *
   * Note that if there is only one wallet (your wallet) is supported, Connect Wallet Modal will skip showing the wallet selection screen and directly render the connectUI of your wallet.
   */
  supportedWallets: WalletConfig[];
};
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> isInstalled </summary>
  <div>

A function that returns a boolean indicating whether your wallet is installed on the user's browser/device or not.

It is used to show an "installed" badge next to your wallet's name in the wallet selector screen in Connect Wallet Modal if this function is defined and returns `true`.

<img src="/assets/connect-wallet/wallet-selector-screen.png" />

</div>
</details>

<br />

### Creating wallet connection UI

```tsx
import { ConnectUIProps } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';

function MyWalletConnectionUI(props: ConnectUIProps<MyWallet>) {
  return <div> ... </div>
}

function myWallet (options?: MyWalletConfig): WalletConfig<MyWallet> {
  // ...
  connectUI(props) {
    return <MyWalletConnectionUI {...props} />;
  }
}
```

## Connecting your wallet in wallet connection UI

There are two ways to connect your wallet in `connectUI`

<details>
  <summary> Using <code>useConnect</code> hook - <em>Recommended</em>  </summary>
  <div>

The recommended way to connect your wallet is to use the [useConnect](/react/react.useconnect) hook.

```tsx
import { ConnectUIProps } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function MyWalletConnectionUI(props: ConnectUIProps<MyWallet>) {
  const connect = useConnect();

  // call this function to connect your wallet
  const handleConnect = async () => {
    try {
      await connect(
        props.walletConfig,
        connectOptions, // if your MyWallet.connect method accepts any options, specify it here
      );

      // close the modal after connecting your wallet
      props.close();
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("failed to connect", e);
      // show error UI or close modal using props.close();
    }
  };

  return <div> ... </div>;
}
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Manually creating wallet instance and connecting  </summary>
  <div>

You should only use this method if need access to wallet instance before connecting your wallet. Otherwise, use the useConnect hook.

There are 3 steps to connect your wallet manually:

- create an instance of your wallet using [useCreateWalletInstance](/react/react.usecreatewalletinstance)
- connect your wallet using the `connect` method of your wallet
- once wallet is connected, set the wallet instance as connected using [useSetConnectedWallet](/react/react.usesetconnectedwallet)

Make sure to update the connectionStatus using [useSetConnectionStatus](/react/react.usesetconnectionstatus) to `"connecting"` before connecting your wallet and `"disconnected"` if the connection fails.

```tsx
import {
  ConnectUIProps,
  useCreateWalletInstance,
  useSetConnectionStatus,
  useSetConnectedWallet,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function MyWalletConnectionUI(props: ConnectUIProps<MyWallet>) {
  const createWalletInstance = useCreateWalletInstance();
  const setConnectionStatus = useSetConnectionStatus();
  const setConnectedWallet = useSetConnectedWallet();

  // call this function to connect your wallet
  const handleConnect = async () => {
    // 1. create instance
    const walletInstance = createWalletInstance(props.walletConfig);
    setConnectionStatus("connecting");

    try {
      // 2. call `connect` method of your wallet
      await walletInstance.connect(
        connectOptions, // if your MyWallet.connect method accepts any options, specify it here
      );

      // 3. set connected wallet
      setConnectedWallet(walletInstance);
      props.close();
    } catch (e) {
      setConnectionStatus("disconnected");
      console.error("failed to connect", e);
      // show error UI or close modal using props.close()
    }
  };

  return <div> ... </div>;
}
```

</div>
</details>

## Rendering a custom UI for selecting your wallet

Instead of the default icon + name in wallet selector screen, you can render a custom UI for your wallet.

Take [paper wallet](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/react/src/wallet/wallets/paperWallet.tsx) for example, It renders a Input field where the user can enter their email address.

<img src="/assets/connect-wallet/paper-wallet-selection-ui.png" />

This can be done by specifying a React component in the `selectUI` property of your wallet config.

```tsx
import { SelectUIProps, ConnectionUIProps, WalletConfig } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';

// example: render a input field where the user can enter their email address
function MyWalletSelectionUI(props: SelectUIProps<MyWallet>) {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const usesMoreWallets = props.supportedWallets.length > 1;

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={email} onChange={e => setEmail(e.target.value)} />
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          props.onSelect(email);
        }}
      >
        submit
      </button>
      {usesMoreWallets && <p> --- OR --- </p>}
    </div>
  );
}

function MyWalletConnectionUI(props: SelectUIProps<MyWallet>) {
  // get the email address entered by the user in MyWalletSelectionUI
  const email = props.selectionData as string;

  return <div> ... </div>;
}

function myWallet (options?: MyWalletConfig): WalletConfig<MyWallet> {
  // ...
  selectUI(props) {
    return <MyWalletSelectionUI {...props} />;
  },
  connectUI(props) {
    return <MyWalletConnectionUI {...props} />
  }
}
```

## Add your wallet to `ThirdwebProvider`

You can now use your wallet in the Connect Wallet button! Simply add it to the `supportedWallets` prop of the `ThirdwebProvider`.

```tsx
<ThirdwebProvider supportedWallets={[myWallet()]}>
  <App />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```
