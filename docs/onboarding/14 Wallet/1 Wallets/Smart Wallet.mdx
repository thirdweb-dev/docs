Let your users connect to their [Smart Wallet](/glossary/smart-wallet).

A Smart Wallet is a wallet that is controlled by a smart contract following the [ERC-4337 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337).

## Features

Smart Wallets work a little differently than other wallets since it's controlled by a programmable smart contract rather than a regular externally-owned account (EOA). This programmable wallet contract can:

- Hold any assets
- Pay for its own gas
- Execute transactions in batches
- Have multiple owners
- Assign roles and permissions

And more! Smart Wallets can be customized to each application's needs using the Solidity SDK.

## Templates

## Requirements

- A deployed account factory contract, you can deploy one in 1-click via the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/smart-wallet)
- An API key, which you can obtain from the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/api-keys)

The API key lets you access thirdweb's bundler and paymaster infrastructure, which is required for the smart wallet to operate and optionally enable [gasless transactions](/glossary/gasless-transactions).

The SmartWallet API is composable - you can bring in your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract and you can also use your own bundler or paymaster services.

## Supported chains

With a thirdweb API key, you get access to bundler and paymaster infrastructure on the following chains:

- Goerli
- Mumbai
- Base Goerli
- Optimism Goerli
- Arbitrum Goerli
- Linea testnet

more chains are added every week, to get support for a specific chain [contact us](https://thirdweb.typeform.com/to/Q93CVgUc?typeform-source=thirdweb-www-git-mariano-ftd-1670.thirdweb-preview.com).

## Usage

**To connect to a smart wallet, a personal wallet (acting as the key to the smart wallet) must first be connected.**

```javascript
import { LocalWallet, SmartWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
import { Goerli } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

// First, connect the personal wallet, which can be any wallet (metamask, walletconnect, etc.)
// Here we're just generating a new local wallet which can be saved later
const personalWallet = new LocalWallet();
await personalWallet.generate();
await personalWallet.connect();

// Setup the Smart Wallet configuration
const config: SmartWalletConfig = {
  chain: Goerli, // the chain where your smart wallet will be or is deployed
  factoryAddress: "{{factory_address}}", // your own deployed account factory address
  thirdwebApiKey: "{{api_key}}", // obtained from the thirdweb dashboard
  gasless: true, // enable or disable gasless transactions
};

// Then, connect the Smart wallet
const wallet = new SmartWallet(config);
await wallet.connect({
  personalWallet,
});
```

## Configuration

Here's the full configuration object you can pass when instantiating the `SmartWallet` class.

## Methods

Inherits all the public methods from the [`AbstractClientWallet`](interfaces/abstract-client-wallet) class.

### connect

Connect the smart wallet to your app using a personal wallet.

This personal wallet must be connected before connecting to a Smart wallet.

```javascript
import { CoinbaseWallet, SmartWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
import { Ethereum } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

// First, connect the personal wallet
const personalWallet = new CoinbaseWallet();
const personalWalletAddress = await personalWallet.connect();

// Then, connect the Smart wallet
const smartWallet = new SmartWallet(config);
const smartWalletAddress = await smartWallet.connect({
  personalWallet,
});
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### personalWallet

The instance of a personal wallet that can sign transactions on the Smart Wallet.

Must be an `EVMWallet` instance such as [`CoinbaseWallet`](/wallet/coinbase-wallet) or [`MetamaskWallet`](/wallet/metamask).

Returns a `string` containing the wallet address, or throws an error if the connection fails.

```typescript
string | undefined;
```

</div>
</details>

### execute

Execute a single transaction as the connected Smart Wallet.

```javascript
// first, connect the Smart wallet
const wallet = new SmartWallet(config);
await wallet.connect({
  personalWallet,
});

// Then you can execute transactions directly
const transaction = prepareTransaction();
await wallet.execute(transaction);
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### transaction

The transaction to execute. Must be of type `Transaction` from the [`@thirdweb-dev/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thirdweb-dev/sdk) package.

Creating these transactions can be done easily using the [Transaction Builder](/typescript/sdk.smartcontract.prepare) from the thirdweb SDK.

Returns a `TransactionResult` containing the transaction receipt.

```typescript
TransactionResult;
```

</div>
</details>

### executeBatch

Execute multiple transactions as the connected Smart Wallet at once, only requiring one signature from the personal wallet.

```javascript
// first, connect the Smart wallet
const wallet = new SmartWallet(config);
await wallet.connect({
  personalWallet,
});

// Then you can execute multiple transactions at once
const transactions = [
  prepareTransaction1(),
  prepareTransaction2(),
  prepareTransaction3(),
];
await wallet.executeBatch(transactions);
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### transactions

An array of transactions to execute. Must be of type `Transaction[]` from the [`@thirdweb-dev/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thirdweb-dev/sdk) package.

Creating these transactions can be done easily using the [Transaction Builder](typescript/sdk.smartcontract.prepare) from the thirdweb SDK.

Returns a `TransactionResult` containing the transaction receipt.

```typescript
TransactionResult;
```

</div>
</details>
