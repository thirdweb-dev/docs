`recoveryShareManagement` indicates who should be in charge of managing the user's recovery share. Choosing `"AWS_MANAGED"` is the easiest to get started and is generally what we recommend.

  colorBackground?: string,
  // The button and link color of the UI components.
  colorPrimary?: string,

<details>
  <summary>walletStorage (optional)</summary>

The wallet needs to store data in persistent storage. By default `localStorage` is used. If you want to use a different storage, you can pass it in the `walletStorage` option.

```typescript
export interface AsyncStorage {
  getItem(key: string): Promise<string | null>;
  setItem(key: string, value: string): Promise<void>;
  removeItem(key: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

Example:

```javascript
import { PaperWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const wallet = new PaperWallet({
  // ... other required config

  // highlight-start
  walletStorage: {
    getItem: (key) => {
      // Implement your own storage logic here
    },
    removeItem: (key) => {
      // Implement your own storage logic here
    },
    setItem: (key, value) => {
      // Implement your own storage logic here
    },
  },
  // highlight-end
});
```
