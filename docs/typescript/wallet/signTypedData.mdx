Sign a typed data structure that follows the [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) standard with the connected wallet.

## Usage

Create a typed data structure and message to be signed (for more information, see [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712)), and pass it to this method.

This will prompt the user to sign the structured message from their wallet (or sign it automatically if [initialized with a private key](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk.fromprivatekey)).

Once signed, the payload and its associated signature are returned.

```javascript
// An example message to ask the user to sign
const message = {
  to: "0x...",
  quantity: 1,
};

// Sign the message with the connected wallet
const { payload, signature } = await sdk.wallet.signTypedData(
  {
    name: "MyEIP721Domain",
    version: "1",
    chainId: 1,
    verifyingContract: "0x...",
  },
  {
    MyStruct: [
      { name: "to", type: "address" },
      { name: "quantity", type: "uint256" },
    ],
  },
  message,
);
```

## Configuration

### domain

The domain object as defined by the [EIP712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) standard.

```javascript
const domain = {
  name: "MyEIP721Domain",
  version: "1",
  chainId: 1,
  verifyingContract: "0x...",
};
```

### types

The structure and data types as defined by the [EIP712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) standard.

```javascript
const types = {
  MyStruct: [
    { name: "to", type: "address" },
    { name: "quantity", type: "uint256" },
  ],
};
```

### message

The data to be signed.

```javascript
const message = {
  to: "0x...",
  quantity: 1,
};
```

## Return Value

Returns an object with the payload and the associated signature:

```typescript
{
  payload: any;
  signature: string;
}
```
