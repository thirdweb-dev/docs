Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`LazyMint`](/contracts/LazyMint) contract and either the
[`Drop`](/contracts/Drop) contract (for claim conditions and claiming), or the
[`IClaimableERC721`](/contracts/IClaimableERC721) contract (for claiming only).

## claim

Claim a specified number of tokens to the **connected wallet**.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.erc721.claim("{{quantity}}");
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### quantity (required)

The number of tokens to claim.

Must be a `string` or `number`.

#### options (optional)

Customizable `ClaimOptions` object that can be used to override the default behaviour of the claim.

There are three options available:

- `checkERC20Allowance` - Whether to check the ERC20 allowance of the sender, defaults to true.
- `currencyAddress` - The currency to pay for each token claimed, defaults to `NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS` for native currency.
- `pricePerToken` - The price to pay for each token claimed. Not relevant when using claim conditions.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.erc721.claim("{{token_id}}", "{{quantity}}", {
  checkERC20Allowance: true,
  currencyAddress: "{{currency_contract_address}}",
  pricePerToken: "{{price}}",
});
```

</div>
</details>

## claimTo

The same as [`claim`](#claim), but allows specifying the recipient
address rather than using the connected wallet.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.erc721.claimTo(
  "{{wallet_address}}",
  "{{quantity}}",
);
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### recipient (required)

The wallet address to receive the claimed tokens.

Must be a `string`.

#### quantity (required)

The number of tokens to claim.

Must be a `string` or `number`.

#### options (optional)

Customizable `ClaimOptions` object that can be used to override the default behaviour of the claim.

See [`claim`](#claim) for more details.

</div>
</details>

## canClaim

Check if tokens are currently available for claiming, optionally specifying if a specific wallet
address can claim.

```javascript
const canClaim = await contract.erc721.claimConditions.canClaim("{{quantity}}");
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### quantity (required)

The amount of tokens to claim.

This checks to see if the specified amount of tokens are available for claiming. i.e.:

- There is sufficient quantity available for claiming.
- This amount of tokens can be claimed in a single transaction.

Must be a `string` or `number`.

#### addressToCheck (optional)

The wallet address to check if it can claim tokens.

This considers all aspects of the active claim phase, including allowlists, previous claims, etc.

Must be a `string`.

### Return Value

Returns a `boolean` indicating if the specified amount of tokens can be claimed or not.

```typescript
boolean;
```

</div>
</details>

## totalClaimedSupply

Get the total number of tokens claimed from the drop so far.

```javascript
const totalClaimedSupply = await contract.erc721.totalClaimedSupply();
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

### Return Value

Returns a `BigNumber` representing the total number of tokens claimed from the drop so far.

```typescript
BigNumber;
```

</div>
</details>

## totalUnclaimedSupply

Get the total number of tokens that are still available to be claimed from the drop.

```javascript
const totalUnclaimedSupply = await contract.erc721.totalUnclaimedSupply();
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

### Return Value

Returns a `BigNumber` representing the total number of tokens that are still available to be claimed from the drop.

```typescript
BigNumber;
```

</div>
</details>

## getActive

Retrieve the currently active claim phase, if any.

```javascript
const activePhase = await contract.erc721.claimConditions.getActive();
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### options (optional)

Provide an object containing a `withAllowlist` property to include the allowlist in the response.

By default, the method will not include the allowlist in the returned data.

To include the allowlist in the returned data, set the `withAllowlist` option to `true`.

This will add a `snapshot` property to the returned data, which contains the allowlist in an array.

```javascript
const activePhase = contract.erc721.claimConditions.getActive({
  withAllowList: true,
});
```

### Return Value

If there is no active claim phase, returns `undefined`.

If a claim condition is active, returns a `ClaimCondition` object containing the following properties:

```typescript
{
  maxClaimableSupply: string;
  startTime: Date;
  price: BigNumber;
  currencyAddress: string;
  maxClaimablePerWallet: string;
  waitInSeconds: BigNumber;
  merkleRootHash: string | number[];
  availableSupply: string;
  currentMintSupply: string;
  currencyMetadata: {
      symbol: string;
      value: BigNumber;

      maxClaimable: string;
  }[] | null | undefined;
}
```

</div>
</details>

## getAll

Get all the claim phases configured for the drop.

```javascript
const claimPhases = await contract.erc721.claimConditions.getAll(
  "{{token_id}}",
);
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### options (optional)

Optionally return the allowlist with each claim phase.

See [`getActive`](#getactive) configuration for more details.

  };
  metadata?: {
      [x: string]: unknown;
      name?: string | undefined;
  } | undefined;
  snapshot?: {
      price?: string | undefined;
      currencyAddress?: string | undefined;
      address: string;
      maxClaimable: string;
  }[] | null | undefined;
}[]
```

</div>
</details>

## getClaimIneligibilityReasons

Get an array of reasons why a specific wallet address is not eligible to claim tokens, if any.

```javascript
const reasons =
  await contract.erc721.claimConditions.getClaimIneligibilityReasons(
    "{{quantity}}",
    "{{wallet_address}}",
  );
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### quantity (required)

The amount of tokens to check if the wallet address can claim.

Must be a `string` or `number`.

#### addressToCheck (optional)

The wallet address to check if it can claim tokens.

Must be a `string`.

### Return Value

Returns an array of `ClaimEligibility` strings, which may be empty.

For example, if the user is not in the allowlist, this hook will return `["This address is not on the allowlist."]`.

If the user _is_ eligible to claim tokens, the hook will return an empty array.

```ts
ClaimEligibility[]

// ClaimEligibility Enum
export enum ClaimEligibility {
  NotEnoughSupply = "There is not enough supply to claim.",
  AddressNotAllowed = "This address is not on the allowlist.",
  WaitBeforeNextClaimTransaction = "Not enough time since last claim transaction. Please wait.",
  AlreadyClaimed = "You have already claimed the token.",
  NotEnoughTokens = "There are not enough tokens in the wallet to pay for the claim.",
  NoActiveClaimPhase = "There is no active claim phase at the moment. Please check back in later.",
  NoClaimConditionSet = "There is no claim condition set.",
  NoWallet = "No wallet connected.",
  Unknown = "No claim conditions found.",
}
```

</div>
</details>

## getClaimTransaction

Construct a claim transaction without executing it.
This is useful for estimating the gas cost of a claim transaction,
overriding transaction options and having fine grained control over the transaction execution.

```javascript
const claimTransaction = await contract.erc721.getClaimTransaction(
  "{{wallet_address}}",
  "{{quantity}}",
);
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### walletAddress (required)

The wallet address to claim tokens for.

Must be a `string`.

#### quantity (required)

The amount of tokens to claim.

Must be a `string`, `number` or `BigNumber`.

#### options (optional)

See [`claim`](#claim) configuration for more details.

### Return Value

```typescript
TransactionTask;
```

</div>
</details>

## getClaimerProofs

Returns allowlist information and merkle proofs for a given wallet address.

```javascript
const claimerProofs = await contract.erc721.claimConditions.getClaimerProofs(
  "{{wallet_address}}",
);
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### walletAddress (required)

The wallet address to get the merkle proofs for.

Must be a `string`.

### Return Value

```typescript
{
    price?: string | undefined;
    currencyAddress?: string | undefined;
    address: string;
    proof: string[];
    maxClaimable: string;
} | null | undefined
```

</div>
</details>

## set

Overwrite the claim conditions for the drop.

All properties of a phase are optional, with the default being a free, open,
unlimited claim, in the native currency, starting immediately.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.erc721.claimConditions.set(
  [
    {
      metadata: {
        name: "Phase 1", // The name of the phase
      },
      currencyAddress: "0x...", // The address of the currency you want users to pay in
      price: 1, // The price of the token in the currency specified above
      maxClaimablePerWallet: 1, // The maximum number of tokens a wallet can claim
      maxClaimableSupply: 100, // The total number of tokens that can be claimed in this phase
      startTime: new Date(), // When the phase starts (i.e. when users can start claiming tokens)
      waitInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // The period of time users must wait between repeat claims
      snapshot: [
        {
          address: "0x...", // The address of the wallet
          currencyAddress: "0x...", // Override the currency address this wallet pays in
          maxClaimable: 5, // Override the maximum number of tokens this wallet can claim
          price: 0.5, // Override the price this wallet pays
        },
      ],
      merkleRootHash: "0x...", // The merkle root hash of the snapshot
    },
  ],
  false, // Whether to resetClaimEligibilityForAll (i.e. reset state of claims for previous claimers)
);
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### price

The price per token in the currency specified above.

The default value is `0`.

#### maxClaimablePerWallet

The maximum number of tokens a wallet can claim.

The default value is `unlimited`.

#### maxClaimableSupply

The total number of tokens that can be claimed in this phase.

For example, if you lazy mint 1000 tokens and set the `maxClaimableSupply` to 100,
then only 100 tokens will be claimable in this phase, leaving 900 tokens to be claimed in the next phases (if you have any).

This is useful for "early bird" use cases, where you allow users to claim a limited number of tokens at a discounted price during
the first X amount of time.

#### startTime

When the phase starts (i.e. when users can start claiming tokens).

The default value is immediately.

#### waitInSeconds

The amount of time between claims a wallet must wait before they can claim again.

The default value is `0`, meaning users can claim again immediately after claiming.

#### snapshot

A list of wallets that you want to override the default claim conditions for.

Wallet addresses within this list can be set to pay in a
different currency, have a different price, and have a different maximum claimable amount.

```ts
{
  address: string;
  currencyAddress?: string;
  maxClaimable?: number;
  price?: number;
}
```

#### merkleRootHash

If you want to provide your own merkle tree for your snapshot, provide the merkle root hash here.

This is only recommended for advanced use cases.

#### resetClaimEligibilityForAll

This means you reset any previous claim conditions that existed and
allow users to claim again as if the drop had just started.

A boolean value that determines whether to reset the claim conditions or to keep the existing state.

By resetting them, any previous claims that were made will be ignored by the claim condition restrictions.

For example, if you had a limit of 1 token per wallet, and a user claimed a token,
then you reset the claim conditions, that user will be able to claim another token.

Must be a `boolean`.

Defaults to `false`.

## update

Update a single claim phase, by providing the index of the claim
phase and the new phase configuration.

The `index` is the position of the phase in the list of phases you have made, starting from zero.
e.g. if you have two phases, the first phase has an index of `0` and the second phase has an index of `1`.

All properties of a phase are optional, with the default being a free, open, unlimited claim, in the native currency, starting immediately.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract?.erc721.claimConditions.update(
  0, // Index of the claim phase to update
  {
    metadata: {
      name: "Phase 1", // The name of the phase
    },
    currencyAddress: "0x...", // The address of the currency you want users to pay in
    price: 1, // The price of the token in the currency specified above
    maxClaimablePerWallet: 1, // The maximum number of tokens a wallet can claim
    maxClaimableSupply: 100, // The total number of tokens that can be claimed in this phase
    startTime: new Date(), // When the phase starts (i.e. when users can start claiming tokens)
    waitInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // The period of time users must wait between repeat claims
    snapshot: [
      {
        address: "0x...", // The address of the wallet
        currencyAddress: "0x...", // Override the currency address this wallet pays in
        maxClaimable: 5, // Override the maximum number of tokens this wallet can claim
        price: 0.5, // Override the price this wallet pays
      },
    ],
    merkleRootHash: "0x...", // The merkle root hash of the snapshot
  },
);
