# ERC1155Mintable

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`IERC1155`](/contracts/IERC1155) and
[`IMintableERC1155`](/contracts/IMintableERC1155) interfaces.

Allows you to mint new NFTs on the contract.

By default, the NFT metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before minting.
You can override this default behavior by providing a `string` that points to valid metadata object instead of an object.

## mint

Mint a new NFT to the **connected wallet**.

```javascript
const metadata = {
  name: "Cool NFT #1",
  description: "This is a cool NFT",
  image: "https://example.com/image.png", // URL, IPFS URI, or File object
  // ... Any other metadata you want to include
};

const tx = await contract.erc1155.mint({
  metadata: metadata,
  supply: 1000, // The number of this NFT you want to mint
});
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### metadataWithSupply

An object containing a `metadata` object and a `supply` property.

The metadata object can either be a string that points to valid metadata that
conforms to the [metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure),
or an object that conforms to the same standards.

If you provide an object, the metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before
the NFT(s) are minted.

```javascript
// Below is an example of using a string rather than an object for metadata
const metadata = "https://example.com/metadata.json"; // Any URL or IPFS URI that points to metadata

const txResult = await contract.erc1155.mint({
  metadata: metadata,
  supply: 1000, // The number of this NFT you want to mint
});
```

</div>
</details>

## mintTo

The same as [`mint`](#mint), but allows you to specify the address of the wallet rather than using the connected wallet.

```javascript
// Address of the wallet you want to mint the NFT to
const toAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";

// Custom metadata of the NFT, note that you can fully customize this metadata with other properties.
const metadata = {
  name: "Cool NFT #1",
  description: "This is a cool NFT",
  image: "https://example.com/image.png", // URL, IPFS URI, or File object
  // ... Any other metadata you want to include
};

const metadataWithSupply = {
  metadata,
  supply: 1000, // The number of this NFT you want to mint
};

const txResult = await contract.erc1155.mintTo(toAddress, metadataWithSupply);
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### to

The address of the wallet you want to mint the NFT to.

Must be a `string`.

```javascript
const metadataWithSupply = {
  // ...
};

const txResult = await contract.erc1155.mintTo(
  // highlight-next-line
  "{{wallet_address}}",
  metadataWithSupply,
);
```

#### metadataWithSupply

Same as [`metadataWithSupply`](#metadatawithsupply) in the [`mint`](#mint) method.

</div>
</details>

## mintAdditionalSupply

Mint additional quantity of an NFT that already exists on the contract.

```javascript
const tokenId = 0;
const additionalSupply = 1000;
const txResult = await contract.erc1155.mintAdditionalSupply(
  tokenId,
  additionalSupply,
);
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### tokenId

The ID of the NFT you want to mint additional supply for.

Must be a `string`, `number`, or `BigNumber`.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.erc1155.mintAdditionalSupply(
  // highlight-next-line
  "{{token_id}}",
  "{{additional_supply}}",
);
```

#### additionalSupply

How much additional supply you want to mint.

Must be a `string`, `number`, or `BigNumber`.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.erc1155.mintAdditionalSupply(
  "{{token_id}}",
  // highlight-next-line
  "{{additional_supply}}",
);
```

</div>
</details>

## mintAdditionalSupplyTo

The same as [`mintAdditionalSupply`](#mintadditionalsupply), but allows you to specify the address of the wallet rather than using the connected wallet.

```javascript
const toAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";
const tokenId = 0;
const additionalSupply = 1000;

const txResult = await contract.erc1155.mintAdditionalSupplyTo(
  toAddress,
  tokenId,
  additionalSupply,
);
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### to

The address of the wallet you want to mint the NFT to.

Must be a `string`.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.erc1155.mintAdditionalSupplyTo(
  // highlight-next-line
  "{{wallet_address}}",
  "{{token_id}}",
  "{{additional_supply}}",
);
```

#### tokenId

The ID of the NFT you want to mint additional supply for.

Must be a `string`, `number`, or `BigNumber`.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.erc1155.mintAdditionalSupplyTo(
  "{{wallet_address}}",
  // highlight-next-line
  "{{token_id}}",
  "{{additional_supply}}",
);
```

#### additionalSupply

How much additional supply you want to mint.

Must be a `string`, `number`, or `BigNumber`.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.erc1155.mintAdditionalSupplyTo(
  "{{wallet_address}}",
  "{{token_id}}",
  // highlight-next-line
  "{{additional_supply}}",
);
```

## getMintTransaction

Construct a mint transaction without executing it.
This is useful for estimating the gas cost of a mint transaction,
overriding transaction options and having fine grained control over the transaction execution.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.erc1155.getMintTransaction(
  "{{wallet_address}}", // Wallet address to mint to
  {
    metadata: {
      name: "Cool NFT #1",
      description: "This is a cool NFT",
      image: "https://example.com/image.png", // URL, IPFS URI, or File object
      // ... Any other metadata you want to include
    },
    supply: 1000, // The number of this NFT you want to mint
  },
);
```

  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### to

The address of the wallet you want to mint the NFT to.

Must be a `string`.

#### metadataWithSupply

See [`metadataWithSupply`](#metadatawithsupply) in the [`mint`](#mint) method.

### Return Value

TransactionTask;

## nextTokenIdToMint
