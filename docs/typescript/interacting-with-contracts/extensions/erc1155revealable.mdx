# ERC1155Revealable

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`IERC1155`](/contracts/IERC1155) and
[`ILazyMint`](/contracts/ILazyMint) interfaces and inherit the
[`DelayedReveal`](/contracts/DelayedReveal) contract.

Allows you to lazy-mint batches of NFTs that are encrypted until a later time,
and reveal them at any time using a password.

## createDelayedRevealBatch

Create a batch of encrypted NFTs that can be revealed at a later time.

Provide an array of metadata for the NFTs you want to create, which can either be a
`string` URL that points to metadata, or an object.
The metadata must conform to the [metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure).

If you provide an object, it is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before being
lazy-minted into the contract.

```javascript
// the real NFTs, these will be encrypted until you reveal them
const realNFTs = [
  {
    name: "Cool NFT #1",
    description: "This is a cool NFT",
    image: "https://example.com/image.png", // URL, IPFS URI, or File object
    // ... Any other metadata you want to include
  },
  {
    name: "Cool NFT #2",
    description: "This is a cool NFT",
    image: "https://example.com/image.png", // URL, IPFS URI, or File object
    // ... Any other metadata you want to include
  },
];

// A placeholder NFT that people will get immediately in their wallet, and will be converted to the real NFT at reveal time
const placeholderNFT = {
  name: "Hidden NFT",
  description: "Will be revealed next week!",
};

// Create and encrypt the NFTs
const txResult = await contract.erc1155.revealer.createDelayedRevealBatch(
  placeholderNFT,
  realNFTs,
  "my secret password",
);
```

### Configuration

#### placeholder

A single metadata `object` or URL string that points to
[valid metadata](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure).

This is the metadata users will see until you [`reveal`](#reveal) the batch.

```javascript
// the real NFTs, these will be encrypted until you reveal them
const realNFTs = [
  // ...
];

// highlight-start
// A placeholder NFT that people will get immediately in their wallet, and will be converted to the real NFT at reveal time
const placeholderNFT = {
  name: "Hidden NFT",
  description: "Will be revealed next week!",
  image: "https://example.com/image.png", // URL, IPFS URI, or File object
  //  ... Any other metadata you want to include
};
// highlight-end

// Create and encrypt the NFTs
const txResult = await contract.erc1155.revealer.createDelayedRevealBatch(
  // highlight-next-line
  placeholderNFT,
  realNFTs,
  "my secret password",
);
```

#### metadatas

An array of metadata objects or URL strings that point to valid metadata.

These are the NFTs that will be revealed when you [`reveal`](#reveal) the batch.

```javascript
// highlight-start
// the real NFTs, these will be encrypted until you reveal them
const realNFTs = [
  {
    name: "Cool NFT #1",
    description: "This is a cool NFT",
    image: "https://example.com/image.png", // URL, IPFS URI, or File object
    // ... Any other metadata you want to include
  },
  {
    name: "Cool NFT #2",
    description: "This is a cool NFT",
    image: "https://example.com/image.png", // URL, IPFS URI, or File object
    // ... Any other metadata you want to include
  },
];
// highlight-end

// A placeholder NFT that people will get immediately in their wallet, and will be converted to the real NFT at reveal time
const placeholderNFT = {
  // ...
};

// Create and encrypt the NFTs
const txResult = await contract.erc1155.revealer.createDelayedRevealBatch(
  placeholderNFT,
  // highlight-next-line
  realNFTs,
  "my secret password",
);
```

#### password

The password that will be used to [`reveal`](#reveal) the batch.

:::warning Unrecoverable

Passwords cannot be recovered or reset. If you forget your password, you will
not be able to reveal your NFTs.

:::

```javascript
const realNFTs = [
  // ...
];
const placeholderNFT = {
  // ...
};

const txResult = await contract.erc1155.revealer.createDelayedRevealBatch(
  placeholderNFT,
  realNFTs,
  // highlight-next-line
  "my secret password",
);
```

## getBatchesToReveal

Get a list of unrevealed batches.

```javascript
const batches = await contract.erc1155.revealer.getBatchesToReveal();
```

### Return Value

Returns an array of `BatchToReveal` objects, containing the following properties:

```typescript
{
  batchId: BigNumber;
  batchUri: string;
  placeholderMetadata: {
      id: string;
      uri: string; // The raw URI of the metadata
      owner: string;
      name?: string | number | undefined;
      description?: string | null | undefined;
      image?: string | null | undefined; // If the image is hosted on IPFS, the URL is https://gateway.ipfscdn.io/ipfs/<hash>
      external_url?: string | null | undefined;
      animation_url?: string | null | undefined;
      background_color?: string | undefined;
      properties?: {
          [x: string]: unknown;
      } | {
          [x: string]: unknown;
      }[] | undefined;
    };
    type: "ERC1155";
  };
}[];
```

## reveal

Reveal a batch of NFTs that were previously created with
[`createDelayedRevealBatch`](#createdelayedrevealbatch).

```javascript
const batchId = 0; // the batch to reveal
await contract.erc1155.revealer.reveal(batchId, "my secret password");
```

### Configuration

#### batchId

The ID of the batch to reveal, which you can get from
[`getBatchesToReveal`](#getbatchestoreveal).

Must be a `string`, `number`, or `BigNumber`.

```javascript
await contract.erc1155.revealer.reveal(
  // highlight-next-line
  "{{batch_id}}",
  "{{password}}",
);
```

#### password

When you create a batch using [`createDelayedRevealBatch`](#createdelayedrevealbatch),
you specify a password. To you reveal the batch, you must provide the same
password.

Must be a `string`.

```javascript
await contract.erc1155.revealer.reveal(
  "{{batch_id}}",
  // highlight-next-line
  "{{password}}",
);
```
