# ContractMetadata

Functionality available for contracts that inherit the [`ContractMetadata`](/contracts/ContractMetadata) contract.

Read, set, or update the metadata of a smart contract, such as it&rsquo;s name, description, image, etc.

If [`Permissions`](/typescript/sdk.permissions) are enabled, `admin` permissions are required to set/update the metadata (unless otherwise specified).

Under the hood, the metadata object you provide is uploaded and pinned to IPFS. The IPFS hash that is returned is then stored on-chain.
When you retrieve the metadata of a contract, the IPFS hash is retrieved from the blockchain and the metadata is retrieved from IPFS
and returned to you in an object.

## get

Get the metadata of a smart contract.

```javascript
const metadata = await contract.metadata.get();
```

### Return Value

While the actual return type is `any`, you can expect an object containing
properties that follow the
[contract level metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/contract-level-metadata), outlined below:

```typescript
{
  name: string; // Name of your smart contract
  description?: string; // Short description of your smart contract
  image?: string; // Image of your smart contract (any URL, or IPFS URI)
  symbol?: string; // Symbol of your smart contract (ticker, e.g. "ETH")
  external_link?: string; // Link to view this smart contract on your website
  seller_fee_basis_points?: number // The fee you charge on secondary sales, e.g. 100 = 1% seller fee.
  fee_recipient?: string; // Wallet address that receives the seller fee
}
```

<hr className="divider" />

## update

Update the metadata of your smart contract.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.metadata.update({
  name: "My Contract",
  description: "My contract description",
});
```

### Configuration

#### metadata

Provide an object containing the metadata of your smart contract following the
[contract level metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/contract-level-metadata).

New properties will be added, and existing properties will be overwritten.
If you do not provide a new value for a previously set property, it will remain unchanged.

```typescript
{
  name: string; // Name of your smart contract
  description?: string; // Short description of your smart contract
  image?: string; // Image of your smart contract (any URL, or IPFS URI)
  symbol?: string; // Symbol of your smart contract (ticker, e.g. "ETH")
  external_link?: string; // Link to view this smart contract on your website
  seller_fee_basis_points?: number // The fee you charge on secondary sales, e.g. 100 = 1% seller fee.
  fee_recipient?: string; // Wallet address that receives the seller fee
}
```

<hr className="divider" />

## set

**Overwrite** the metadata of a contract, an object following the
[contract level metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/contract-level-metadata).

This operation ignores any existing metadata and replaces it with the new metadata provided.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.metadata.set({
  name: "My Contract",
  description: "My contract description",
});
```

### Configuration
