title: Detecting Contract Features
slug: /sdk.thirdwebsdk.detectfeatures
---

In the case where you don&rsquo;t know ahead of time the functionality available in a contract,
use the following methods to determine what extension interfaces you can use.

## isFeatureEnabled

Detect whether or not a given smart contract supports a given extension.

```javascript
import { isFeatureEnabled, ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

// ... Logic to initialize the SDK and get your contract
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK("ethereum");
const contract = await sdk.getContract("0x...");

// Detect whether the contract supports e.g. the "ERC721" extension
const hasFeature = await isFeatureEnabled(contract.abi, "ERC721");
```

#### abi

The ABI of the smart contract to check.

When using the `getContract` method, the ABI is available on the `abi` property of the returned contract object.

#### featureName

The name of the extension to check support for.

View a full list of extension names on the [Extensions overview page](/typescript/extensions).

### Return Value

Returns a `boolean` indicating whether or not the contract supports the given extension.

The return value will be `true` if the contract supports the extension, and `false` if it does not.

```typescript
boolean;
```

## getAllDetectedFeatureNames

Get an array of the names of the features a given smart contract supports.

```javascript
import { detectContractFeature, ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

// ... Logic to initialize the SDK and get your contract
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK("ethereum");
const contract = await sdk.getContract("0x...");

// Get an array of the extensions the contract supports
const features = getAllDetectedFeatureNames(contract.abi);
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### abi

The ABI of the smart contract to check.

When using the `getContract` method, the ABI is available on the `abi` property of the returned contract object.

### Return Value

Returns an array of strings containing the names of the extensions the contract supports.

```typescript
string[];
```
