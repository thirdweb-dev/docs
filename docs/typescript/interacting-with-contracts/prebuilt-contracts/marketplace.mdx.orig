When using the [Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace) smart contract, additional top-level functionality is available to use.

To access the top-level functionality, provide the `marketplace` contract type when creating the contract instance:

```javascript
const contract = await sdk.getContract(
  "{{contract_address}}",
  // highlight-next-line
  "marketplace", // Provide the "marketplace" contract type
);
```

## allowListingFromAnyAsset

Set the marketplace to accept the listing of NFTs from any smart contract.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.allowListingFromAnyAsset();
```

## allowListingFromSpecificAssetOnly

Set the marketplace to accept the listing of **only** NFTs from a specific NFT smart contract.

```javascript
const txResult = await contract.allowListingFromSpecificAssetOnly(
  "{{asset_contract_address}}",
);
```
