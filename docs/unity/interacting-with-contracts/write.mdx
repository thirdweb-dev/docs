# Call Functions

If the functionality of your smart contract does not come under one of the [extension interfaces](/typescript/extensions#extensions),
use the generic `Write` method to call any function on the smart contract.

The result of the transaction can be read by awaiting the result of the `Write`.
The call will be awaited until the transaction is mined and the transaction receipt is available.

## Usage

```csharp
var data = await contract.Write("functionName");
```

## Configuration

### functionName

The name of the function, view, mapping, variable, etc. on your smart contract.

Must be a `string`.

### args

The arguments to the function/variable, in the same order they are on your smart contract.

If you provide too few or too many arguments, the function will throw an error.

```csharp
var data = await contract.Read<int>("functionName", new object[] { "arg1", "arg2" });
```
