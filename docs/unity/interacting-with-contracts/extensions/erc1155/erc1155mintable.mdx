# ERC1155Mintable

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`IERC1155`](/contracts/IERC1155) and
[`IMintableERC1155`](/contracts/IMintableERC1155) interfaces.

Allows you to mint new NFTs on the contract.

By default, the NFT metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before minting.
You can override this default behavior by providing a `string` that points to valid metadata object instead of an object.

## Mint

Mint a new NFT to the **connected wallet**.

```csharp
var data = await contract.ERC1155.Mint(new NFTMetadataWithSupply() {
    supply = 1,
    metadata = new NFTMetadata() {
        name = "My NFT", // Name of the NFT
        image = "my-image-url", // An image URL or IPFS URI
        // Any other valid metadata properties
    }
});
```

#### metadataWithSupply

Provide a `string` that points to, or an `NFTMetadataWithSupply` struct containing
`metadata` that conforms to the [metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure),
along with the `supply` of the NFT to mint.

If you provide a struct, the metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before
the NFT(s) are minted.

The `image` property can be an IPFS URI, or a URL to an image.

## MintTo

The same as [`mint`](#mint), but allows you to specify the address of the wallet rather than using the connected wallet.

```csharp
var data = await contract.ERC1155.MintTo("{{wallet_address}}", new NFTMetadataWithSupply() {
    supply = 1,
    metadata = new NFTMetadata() {
        name = "My NFT", // Name of the NFT
        image = "my-image-url", // An image URL or IPFS URI
        // Any other valid metadata properties
    }
});
```
