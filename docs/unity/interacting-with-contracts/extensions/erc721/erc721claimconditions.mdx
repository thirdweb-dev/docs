Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`LazyMint`](/contracts/LazyMint) contract and either the
[`Drop`](/contracts/Drop) contract (for claim conditions and claiming), or the
[`IClaimableERC721`](/contracts/IClaimableERC721) contract (for claiming only).

## Claim

Claim a specified number of tokens to the **connected wallet**.

```csharp
var data = await contract.ERC721.Claim(1);
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### quantity (required)

The number of tokens to claim.

Must be an `int`.

</div>
</details>

## ClaimTo

The same as [`claim`](#claim), but allows specifying the recipient
address rather than using the connected wallet.

```csharp
var data = await contract.ERC721.ClaimTo("{{wallet_address}}", 1);
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### recipient (required)

The wallet address to receive the claimed tokens.

Must be a `string`.

#### quantity (required)

The number of tokens to claim.

Must be an `int`.

</div>
</details>

## CanClaim

Check if tokens are currently available for claiming, optionally specifying if a specific wallet
address can claim.

```csharp
var data = await contract.ERC721.claimConditions.CanClaim(1, "{{wallet_address}}");
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### quantity (required)

The amount of tokens to claim.

This checks to see if the specified amount of tokens are available for claiming. i.e.:

- There is sufficient quantity available for claiming.
- This amount of tokens can be claimed in a single transaction.

Must be an `int`.

#### addressToCheck (optional)

The wallet address to check if it can claim tokens.

This considers all aspects of the active claim phase, including allowlists, previous claims, etc.

Must be a `string`.

### Return Value

Returns a `bool` indicating if the specified amount of tokens can be claimed or not.

```csharp
bool
```

</div>
</details>

## TotalClaimedSupply

Get the total number of tokens claimed from the drop so far.

```csharp
var data = await contract.ERC721.TotalClaimedSupply();
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

### Return Value

Returns an `int` representing the total number of tokens claimed from the drop so far.

```csharp
int
```

</div>
</details>

## TotalUnclaimedSupply

Get the total number of tokens that are still available to be claimed from the drop.

```csharp
var data = await contract.ERC721.TotalUnclaimedSupply();
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

### Return Value

Returns an `int` representing the total number of tokens that are still available to be claimed from the drop.

```csharp
int
```

</div>
</details>

## GetActive

Retrieve the currently active claim phase, if any.

```csharp
var data = await contract.ERC721.claimConditions.GetActive();
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

### Return Value

If there is no active claim phase, returns `undefined`.

If a claim condition is active, returns a `ClaimConditions` struct containing the following properties:

```csharp
{
    string availableSupply;
    string currentMintSupply;
    CurrencyValue currencyMetadata;
    string currencyAddress;
    string maxClaimableSupply;
    string maxClaimablePerWallet;
    string waitInSeconds;
}
```

</div>
</details>

## GetIneligibilityReasons

Get an array of reasons why a specific wallet address is not eligible to claim tokens, if any.

```csharp
var data = await contract.ERC721.claimConditions.GetIneligibilityReasons(1, "{{wallet_address}}");
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### quantity (required)

The amount of tokens to check if the wallet address can claim.

Must be an `int`.

#### addressToCheck (optional)

The wallet address to check if it can claim tokens.

Must be a `string`.

### Return Value

Returns an array of `ClaimEligibility` strings, which may be empty.

For example, if the user is not in the allowlist, this hook will return `["This address is not on the allowlist."]`.

If the user _is_ eligible to claim tokens, the hook will return an empty array.

```csharp
string[];

// Examples:
{
  NotEnoughSupply = "There is not enough supply to claim.",
  AddressNotAllowed = "This address is not on the allowlist.",
  WaitBeforeNextClaimTransaction = "Not enough time since last claim transaction. Please wait.",
  AlreadyClaimed = "You have already claimed the token.",
  NotEnoughTokens = "There are not enough tokens in the wallet to pay for the claim.",
  NoActiveClaimPhase = "There is no active claim phase at the moment. Please check back in later.",
  NoClaimConditionSet = "There is no claim condition set.",
  NoWallet = "No wallet connected.",
  Unknown = "No claim conditions found.",
}
```

</div>
</details>

## GetClaimerProofs

Returns allowlist information and merkle proofs for a given wallet address.

```csharp
var data = await contract.ERC721.claimConditions.GetClaimerProofs("{{wallet_address}}");
```

<details>
    <summary>Configuration</summary>
    <div>

#### walletAddress (required)

The wallet address to get the merkle proofs for.

Must be a `string`.

### Return Value

```csharp
bool;
```

</div>
</details>
