# PackVRF

Functionality available for contracts that implement the
[`IPackVRFDirect`](/contracts/IPackVRFDirect) interface;
the [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/introduction) variation of the pack interface.

## addPackOpenEventListener

Create an event listener that calls a `callback` function whenever a pack is opened on the contract.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = await contract.vrf.addPackOpenEventListener(
  (packId, openerAddress, rewards) => {
    console.log(
      `Pack ${packId} was opened by ${openerAddress} and contained:, ${rewards})`,
    );
  },
);
```
