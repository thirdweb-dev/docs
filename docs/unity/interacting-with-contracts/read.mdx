# Call Functions

If the functionality of your smart contract does not come under one of the [extension interfaces](/typescript/extensions#extensions),
use the generic `Read` method to retrieve the data, and store the value by awaiting the function call.

## Usage

```csharp
var data = await contract.Read<int>("functionName");
```

## Configuration

### type (generic type)

The type of data returned by the function call. This is used to convert the data returned by the function call into the correct type.
For example, if your function returns a `string`, you would use `string` as the [generic type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/generics/generic-type-parameters).

### functionName

The name of the function, view, mapping, variable, etc. on your smart contract.

Must be a `string`.

### args

The arguments to the function/variable, in the same order they are on your smart contract.

If you provide too few or too many arguments, the function will throw an error.

```csharp
var data = await contract.Read<int>("functionName", "arg1", "arg2", ...);
```
