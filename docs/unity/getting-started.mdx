Before getting started, you'll need to
[download and install the Unity Hub and Unity Editor](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/install-the-unity-hub-and-editor).

:::info
You will require an API key to use thirdweb’s infrastructure services with the SDK. If you haven’t created a key yet you can do so for free from the [**thirdweb dashboard**](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).
:::

Import the thirdweb SDK, by downloading the `.unitypackage` file for the version of the SDK
you want to use (_usually you’ll want the latest version_) from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/releases) on the GitHub repository:

![Download Unity Package](./assets/unitypackage.png)

Add the package to your Unity project by clicking `Assets` > `Import Package` > `Custom Package` like so:

Select the `.unitypackage` file you just downloaded from GitHub to open the `Import Unity Package` menu.

Leave the default files selected, and click `Import`:

In your `Project` window now, you'll be able to see all of the resources that were imported:

Now you’re ready to use the SDK. In your `Project` window, navigate to `Thirdweb` > `Core` > `Prefabs` > `ThirdwebManager` drag it into your scene. This [ThirdwebManager](./ThirdwebManager) acts as a singleton manager class for your Thirdweb SDK, providing a convenient interface for setting up and controlling SDK parameters directly from the Unity inspector.

Alternatively, use our handy quickstart installer! Accessible from the top level `Thirdweb` menu.

All the configurable parameters are annotated with tooltips, just hover over them in the inspector to understand their purpose. After you have set up your [ThirdwebManager](./ThirdwebManager) according to your needs, you can access the SDK from any script using `ThirdwebManager.Instance.SDK`.
