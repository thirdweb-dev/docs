The `ThirdwebManager` is a MonoBehaviour that provides a convenient and customizable way to instantiate and manage the [ThirdwebSDK](/unity/thirdwebsdk). Add the prefab to your scene and the SDK will persist throughout your game's lifecycle. It can be found at `Thirdweb/Core/Prefabs/ThirdwebManager`.

## Configuration

Configure `ThirdwebManager` through the Unity Inspector window. Here are the sections and their respective settings:

### General Settings

This section involves the basic blockchain configurations. Adjust the following settings:

- `Active Chain`: The identifier for the default blockchain to use.
- `Supported Chains`: A list of all blockchains your game supports. For each chain, provide an identifier, a chain ID, and optionally, an RPC override.
- `Client ID`: Thirdweb [API Key](https://thirdweb.com/api-key). Used for default thirdweb services such as Storage and Account Abstraction.
- `Bundle ID Override`: Optional override for the bundle ID used by thirdweb services. Defaults to Application Identifier and can be fetched using `Utils.GetBundleId()`.
- `Initialize On Awake`: Whether the SDK should initialize on awake or not. If not, you can call `ThirdwebManager.Instance.Initialize("chain-identifier")` to initialize it manually.
- `Show Debug Logs`: Whether to show thirdweb sdk debug logs.
- `Thirdweb Config`: SciptableObject for additional Thirdweb configuration. Generated automatically. Mainly used to set custom schemes for google login.

## Accessing the SDK

var sdk = ThirdwebManager.Instance.SDK;
```
