The `ThirdwebManager` is a MonoBehaviour that provides a convenient and customizable way to instantiate and manage the [ThirdwebSDK](/unity/thirdwebsdk). By attaching this script to a GameObject in your initial scene and using `DontDestroyOnLoad()`, the SDK remains instantiated throughout your game's lifecycle.

## Configuration

Configure `ThirdwebManager` through the Unity Inspector window. Here are the sections and their respective settings:

### General Settings

This section involves the basic blockchain configurations. Adjust the following settings:

- `Supported Chains`: A list of all blockchains your game /api-keyssupports. For each chain, provide an identifier, a chain ID, and optionally, an RPC override.
- `Client ID`: Thirdweb [API Key](https://thirdweb.com/api-key). Used for default thirdweb services such as Storage and Account Abstraction.

### App Metadata

This section lets you define how your app appears in wallet providers like Metamask, WalletConnect, and MagicLink. Modify the following fields:

- `App Description`: A brief description of your app.
- `App Icons`: Your app's icons.
- `App URL`: The URL for your app.

### Storage Options

Here, you can specify the URL for your IPFS gateway, which stores your assets in a decentralized way. Edit the following:

### Native Prefabs (Danger Zone)

This section allows you to provide GameObject prefabs for native wallet providers, which will be instantiated at runtime. Adjust the following:

- `Paper Prefab`: The prefab for Paper's UI/behavior.

## Accessing the SDK

Once `ThirdwebManager` is set up and the game starts, it will instantiate the Thirdweb SDK based on your settings. You can access the instantiated SDK from other scripts using:

```csharp
var sdk = ThirdwebManager.Instance.SDK;
```
