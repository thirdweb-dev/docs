title: Get
slug: /events/get
---

Get a list of a specific event&rsquo;s occurrences emitted from the contract during a specified time period.

## Usage

Provide the name of the event, and an optional filter to define the time period to get events for.

```csharp
// Define the shape of the event data
public struct MyEvent
{
    public string from;
    public string to;
    public string tokenId;
}

// Get all emitted events
var data = await contract.events.Get<MyEvent>("eventName");
```

## Configuration

### structure (generic type)

The event data structure to deserialize into, i.e. what shape the event data should be in.

### eventName

The name of the event to get logs for.

In Solidity, an event is triggered by the `emit` keyword.

```solidity title="Example.sol"
// An example Solidity contract
emit Transfer(); // Triggering event
```

To listen to this event, use the name of the event as it appears in the contract.

```csharp
var data = await contract.events.Get<MyEvent>("Transfer");
```

### filters (optional)

An optional object containing the `fromBlock` and `toBlock` numbers for the time period to get events for.

The `order` field indicates the ordering of the events; `desc` (descending) or `asc` (ascending).

The `filters` field allows you to filter on [indexed event parameters](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/contracts.html#index-14).

The default `fromBlock` is `0` and the default `toBlock` is `latest`.

```csharp
var data = await contract.events.Get<MyEvent>("eventName", new EventQueryOptions()
{
  fromBlock = 0,
  toBlock = 1000000,
  order = "desc",
})
```
