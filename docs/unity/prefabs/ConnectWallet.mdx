title: Connect Wallet Button
slug: /connectwallet
---

The `ConnectWallet` prefab allows users to connect their wallet to your game.

It uses the [ThirdwebManager](/unity/ThirdwebManager) to determine which networks to display as well as the secondary UI related to certain providers such as WalletConnect.

You can set up which wallets you want to support from the Prefab_ConnectWallet Inspector directly.

When a user clicks the button, a dropdown of [supported wallets](#supported-wallets) will appear. The user can then
select their preferred wallet to connect to the game; once connected, the button will show the user&rsquo;s balance and an option to
switch networks if multiple networks are set up through the ThirdwebManager.

The prefab is located at: `Assets/Thirdweb/Examples/Prefabs/Prefab_ConnectWallet.prefab`.
