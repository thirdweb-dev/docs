## ThirdwebProvider variable

The `<ThirdwebProvider />` component lets you control what networks you want users to connect to, what types of wallets can connect to your app, and the settings for the \[Typescript SDK\](https://docs.thirdweb.com/typescript).

**Signature:**

```typescript
ThirdwebProvider: <TSupportedChain extends SupportedChain = SupportedChain>({ sdkOptions, chainRpc, supportedChains, walletConnectors, dAppMeta, desiredChainId, storageInterface, autoConnect, children, }: React.PropsWithChildren<ThirdwebProviderProps<TSupportedChain>>) => JSX.Element
```

## Example

You can wrap your application with the provider as follows:

```jsx title="App.jsx"
import { ThirdwebProvider, ChainId } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={ChainId.Mainnet}>
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```
