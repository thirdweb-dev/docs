Hook for getting the active claim condition on a drop contract for a specific wallet address.

As part of our [improved claim conditions](https://blog.thirdweb.com/announcing-improved-claim-conditions/) update, each wallet address can
have unique claim conditions at any given time. This hook allows you to get the active claim condition for a specific wallet address at this time.

Available for contracts that implement claim phases; such as NFT Drop, Edition Drop, and Token Drop.

```jsx
import { useActiveClaimConditionForWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your drop contract as the first argument to the hook.

- Returns the default claim condition on the contract if the address is not found in the claimer snapshot.
- Populates the `error` field if there is no active claim condition on the contract.

```jsx
import {
  useActiveClaimConditionForWallet,
  useContract,
  useAddress,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  // Contract can be any contract that implements claim conditions.
  // Including ERC721, ERC1155, and ERC20 drop contracts.
  const address = useAddress();
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useActiveClaimConditionForWallet(
    contract,
    address,
  );
}
```

## Configuration

### tokenId

The third (optional) parameter is the `tokenId`.

When using the hook with ERC1155 contracts, pass the `tokenId` as the thirdweb parameter; as each token can have unique claim conditions.

Pass `undefined`, or leave this field out if you are using ERC721 or ERC20 drop contracts.

```jsx
import {
  useActiveClaimConditionForWallet,
  useContract,
  useAddress,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const address = useAddress();

  // "data" now includes a "snapshot" property that contains the allowlist.
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useActiveClaimConditionForWallet(
    contract,
    address,
    // highlight-start
    0, // Token ID required for ERC1155 contracts here.
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, contains the following properties:

```jsx
{
  maxClaimableSupply: string;
  startTime: Date;
  price: BigNumber;
  currencyAddress: string;
  maxClaimablePerWallet: string;
  waitInSeconds: BigNumber;
  merkleRootHash: string | number[];
  availableSupply: string;
  currentMintSupply: string;
  currencyMetadata: {
      symbol: string;
      value: BigNumber;
      name: string;
      decimals: number;
      displayValue: string;
  };
}
```
