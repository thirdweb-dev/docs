Hook to get the claimer proofs for an address for [ERC20](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit/base-contracts/erc-20/erc20drop), [ERC721](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit/base-contracts/erc-721/erc721drop), and [ERC1155](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit/base-contracts/erc-1155/erc1155drop) drop contracts.

A claimer proof is a set of data about a claimer's claim condition, including the claimer's address, the claimer's proof, and the claimer's max claimable amount, price, and currency address.

Available for contracts that implement the [claim conditions](/contractkit/interfaces/erc721claimablewithconditions)
interface; such as [NFT Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721), [Edition Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC1155),
and [Token Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC20).

```jsx
import { useClaimerProofs } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your Drop contract as the first argument and the claimer's address as the second argument.

```jsx
import { useClaimerProofs, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);

  const {
    data: proof,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useClaimerProofs(contract, "{{claimer_address}}");
}
```

## Configuration

### claimerAddress

The second parameter is the `claimerAddress`. This is the address of the user you want to get the proof for.

Likely, you will want to check proofs of the currently connected wallet address.

You can use the useAddress hook to get this value.

```jsx
import { useAddress, useClaimerProofs, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  // highlight-start
  const address = useAddress();
  // highlight-end

  const {
    data: proof,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useClaimerProofs(
    contract,
    // highlight-start
    address, // Use useAddress hook to get current wallet address
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```

### tokenId

When using the hook with ERC1155 contracts, pass the `tokenId` as the third parameter; as each token can have unique claim conditions.

Pass `undefined`, or leave this field out if you are using ERC721 or ERC20 drop contracts.

```jsx
import { useClaimerProofs, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);

  const {
    data: proof,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useClaimerProofs(
    contract,
    "{{claimer_address}}",
    // highlight-start
    0, // Token ID required for ERC1155 contracts here.
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```

### claimConditionID

The fourth parameter is `claimConditionId`. This is the ID of the claim condition you want to get the proof for.

```jsx
import { useClaimerProofs, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);

  // "data" now includes a proof for the claim condition with ID 0.
  const {
    data: proof,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useClaimerProofs(
    contract,
    "{{claimer_address}}",
    undefined,
    // highlight-start
    0, // Claim condition ID here.
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, contains the following properties:

```ts
{
    price?: string | undefined;
    currencyAddress?: string | undefined;
    address: string;
    proof: string[];
    maxClaimable: string;
}
```
