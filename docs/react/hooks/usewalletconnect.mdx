Hook for initiating a [Wallet Connect](https://walletconnect.org/) connection prompt for the user.

```jsx
import { useWalletConnect } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

The hook returns a function that, when called, will launch the Wallet Connect popup.

```jsx
import { useWalletConnect } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const connectWithWalletConnect = useWalletConnect();

  return (
    <button onClick={connectWithWalletConnect}>Connect WalletConnect</button>
  );
}
```

When the user clicks the button, a popup will appear prompting them to scan the QR code from their mobile wallet.
Once the user scans the QR code from a Wallet Connect supported mobile wallet, their wallet will be connected to the page as expected.

You can then use the [`useAddress`](/react/hooks/useaddress) hook to get the address of the connected wallet.
