Hook for getting the metadata associated with a smart contract.

Available to use on contracts that implement the [Contract Metadata](/contractkit/extension-contracts/contractmetadata) interface.

```jsx
import { useMetadata } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your contract instance as the argument.

```jsx
import { useContract, useMetadata } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useMetadata(contract);
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, is an object containing the contract's metadata.

```jsx
CustomContractMetadata | undefined;
```

The exact shape of the object depends on the type of metadata provided by the contract.

```jsx
interface CustomContractMetadata {
  /**
   * A description of the contract.
   */
  description?: string;
  /**
   * The image associated with the contract.
   */
  image?: any;
  /**
   * An external link associated with the contract.
   */
  external_link?: string;
  /**
   * The name of the contract.
   */
  name: string;
}
```
