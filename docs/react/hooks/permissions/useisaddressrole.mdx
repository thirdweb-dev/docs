Hook to check if an address is a member of a role on a smart contract.

Available to use on contracts that implement [Permission Controls](/solidity/extension-contracts/permissions).

```jsx
import { useIsAddressRole } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide the following arguments to the hook:

1. `contract` - The contract instance to check the role on.
2. `roleName` - The name of the role to check.
3. `address` - The wallet address to see if it is a member of the role.

```jsx
import { useIsAddressRole, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address (must implement permission controls)
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// Address of the wallet to check
const walletAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";

// Name of the role to check
const roleName = "admin";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const isMember = useIsAddressRole(contract, roleName, walletAddress);
}
```

## Configuration

### roleName (reuqired)

The name of the role to check.
Can be any custom role, or a built-in role, such as `admin`, `transfer`, `minter`, `pauser`, `lister`, `asset`, `unwrap`, or `factory`.

```jsx
import { useIsAddressRole, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address (must implement permission controls)
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// Address of the wallet to check
const walletAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";

// Name of the role to check
// highlight-next-line
const roleName = "admin";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  // Address of the wallet to check
  const isMember = useIsAddressRole(
    contract,
    // highlight-next-line
    roleName,
    walletAddress,
  );
}
```

### walletAddress (reuqired)

The wallet address to check if it is a member of the role.

Use the [`useAddress`](/react/react.useaddress) hook to get the current wallet address.

```jsx
import { useIsAddressRole, useContract, useAddress } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address (must implement permission controls)
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

// Name of the role to check
const roleName = "admin";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  // Address of the wallet to check
  // highlight-next-line
  const address = useAddress();
  const isMember = useIsAddressRole(
    contract,
    roleName,
    // highlight-next-line
    address,
  );
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's returns a boolean, indicating if the given address is a member of the role. `true` if it is, and `false` if it isn't.

```ts
boolean;
```
