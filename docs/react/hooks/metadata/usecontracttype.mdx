Hook for determining the type of contract given a contract address.

This is useful if you want to determine if a contract is a [prebuilt contract](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts).

```jsx
import { useContractType } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your contract address as the argument.

```jsx
import { useContractType } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useContractType(contractAddress);
}
```

## Return Values

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, will be one of the following values:

```jsx
`split` |
  `custom` | // If the contract is not prebuilt, it will be "custom".
  `edition-drop` |
  `edition` |
  `marketplace` |
  `marketplace-v3` |
  `multiwrap` |
  `nft-collection` |
  `nft-drop` |
  `pack` |
  `signature-drop` |
  `token-drop` |
  `token` |
  `vote` |
  `null`;
```
