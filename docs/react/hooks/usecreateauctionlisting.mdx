Hook for creating an auction listing on a marketplace smart contract.

Available to use on smart contracts that implement the [Marketplace](/contractkit/interfaces/marketplace)
or [MarketplaceV3](/contractkit/interfaces/marketplacev3) standard.

```jsx
import { useCreateAuctionListing } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your [Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace)
or
[MarketplaceV3](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/MarketplaceV3)
contract as the argument to the hook.

## Configuration

### tokenId

The ID of the NFT you are listing for auction.

```jsx
import {
  useCreateAuctionListing,
  useContract,
  Web3Button,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace-v3");
  const {
    mutateAsync: createAuctionListing,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useCreateAuctionListing(contract);

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        createAuctionListing({
          assetContractAddress: "{{asset_contract_address}}",
          tokenId: "{{token_id}}",
          currencyContractAddress: "{{currency_contract_address}}",
          quantity: "{{quantity}}",
          buyoutBidAmount: "{{buyout_bid_amount}}",
          minimumBidAmount: "{{minimum_bid_amount}}",
          startTimestamp: new Date(),
          endTimestamp: new Date(
            new Date().getTime() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // e.g. 7 days from now
          ),
          bidBufferBps: "{{bid_buffer_bps}}",
          timeBufferInSeconds: "{{time_buffer_in_seconds}}",
        })
      }
    >
      Create Auction Listing
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```

### assetContractAddress

The smart contract address of the NFT you are listing for auction.

### tokenId

The ID of the NFT you are listing for auction.

### currencyContractAddress

The address of the currency you want users to pay with and make bids in.

You likely want to use the token native to the chain you are on, e.g. Ether on Ethereum.

To do that, you can import the `NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS` constant from `@thirdweb-dev/sdk`.

```jsx
import {
  useCreateAuctionListing,
  useContract,
  Web3Button,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
// highlight-next-line
import { NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace-v3");
  const {
    mutateAsync: createAuctionListing,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useCreateAuctionListing(contract);

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        createAuctionListing({
          tokenId: "{{token_id}}", // The ID of the token to list.
          assetContractAddress: "{{asset_contract_address}}", // The contract address of the asset being listed.
          // highlight-next-line
          currencyContractAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS, // The address of the currency to accept for the listing.
          quantity: "{{quantity}}",
          startTimestamp: new Date(),
          buyoutBidAmount: "{{buyout_bid_amount}}",
          minimumBidAmount: "{{minimum_bid_amount}}",
          endTimestamp: new Date(),
          bidBufferBps: "{{bid_buffer_bps}}",
          timeBufferInSeconds: "{{time_buffer_in_seconds}}",
        })
      }
    >
      Create Auction Listing
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```

### quantity

How many tokens to include in the listing.

- For ERC721 NFTs, this is always `1`.
- For ERC1155 NFTs, this is the quantity of tokens to include in the listing.

### buyoutBidAmount

The price to **buy** each token in the listing.

- For ERC721 NFTs, this is the price to buy the NFT outright.
- For ERC1155 NFTs, this is the price to `1` quantity of the NFT.

### minimumBidAmount

The minimum price that a bid must be in order to be placed on the listing, per token.

Bids that are lower than the reserve price will be rejected by the contract.

### startTimestamp

A `Date` object for the start time of the listing.

### endTimestamp (optional)

A `Date` object for the end time of the listing (when the listing will expire).

### bidBufferBps (optional)

Bid buffer in basis points (1/100th of a percent).

The bid buffer is what percentage higher the next bid must be than the current highest bid.

For example, if you set a bid buffer of `100`, then the next bid must be at least `1%` higher than the current highest bid.

### timeBufferInSeconds (optional)

Time buffer in seconds.

The time buffer is how much time is added to the listing when a new bid is placed.

This is to prevent users from placing a bid at the last second and winning the auction.
