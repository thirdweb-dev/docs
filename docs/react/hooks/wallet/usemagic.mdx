Hook that prompts users to connect to your app using their email or phone number with [Magic Link](/wallet/magic)

```jsx
import { useMagic } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

calling this hook returns a `connect` function.

There are two ways to call this `conect` function: using `email` or `phoneNumber`

If you call the `connect` function with `email`, a modal will open and prompt the user to click on the link sent to their email. Once user completes this step, the modal will close and the user will be connected to your app.

If you call the connect method with `phoneNumber`, a modal will open and prompt the user to enter the OTP sent to their phone number. Once the user enters the OTP, the modal will close and the user will be connected to your app.

Once connected, you can use the [`useAddress`](/react/react.useaddress) hook to get the user's address

Magic SDK requires an apiKey for instantiation. You can create a `apiKey` for your app on [magic.link](https://magic.link/)

```jsx
import { useMagic } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const connectWithMagic = useMagic();

  return (
    <>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          connectWithMagic({
            apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
            email: "user@example.com", // user's email
          });
        }}
      >
        connect with email
      </button>

      <button
        onClick={() => {
          connectWithMagic({
            apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
            phoneNumber: "+123456789", // user's phone number
          });
        }}
      >
        connect with phone number
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

  <summary>chainId (optional)</summary>
  <div>

To connect to a specific chain when connecting the wallet,
pass the `chainId` in a configuration object as shown below.

```ts
chainId: number;
```

```jsx
import { useMagic } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";

function App() {
  const connectWithMagic = useMagic();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        connectWithMagic({
          apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
          chainId: Polygon.chainId,
          email: "user@example.com",
        })
      }
    >
      Connect Wallet
    </button>
  );
}
```

You must add this chain in `ThirdwebProvider`&rsquo;s [supportedChains](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedChains) prop as shown below

```jsx
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export function YourApp() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider supportedChains={[Polygon]}>
