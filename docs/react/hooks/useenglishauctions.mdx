Hook to get a list of all English auctions from a [Marketplace V3](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/MarketplaceV3) contract.

```jsx
import { useEnglishAuctions } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

To get a list of all English auctions, provide your Marketplace v3 contract instance and an optional filter object.

```jsx
import { useEnglishAuctions, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace-v3");
  const {
    data: englishAuctions,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useEnglishAuctions(contract);
}
```

## Configuration

### filter

The `filter` object allows you to filter the auctions returned by the hook.

```jsx
import { useEnglishAuctions, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// Your smart contract address
const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace-v3");
  const {
    data: englishAuctions,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useEnglishAuctions(
    contract,
    // highlight-start
    {
      count: 100, // Number of auctions to fetch
      offeror: "{{offeror_address}}", // Has offers from this address
      seller: "{{seller_address}}", // Being sold by this address
      start: 0, // Start from this index (pagination)
      tokenContract: "{{token_contract_address}}", // Only show NFTs from this collection
      tokenId: "{{token_id}}", // Only show NFTs with this ID
    },
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```
