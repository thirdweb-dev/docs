Hook to get the instance of the [ThirdwebSDK](/typescript/sdk.thirdwebsdk) class being used by the [`ThirdwebProvider`](/react/react.thirdwebprovider) component.

This gives access to all of the functionality of the [TypeScript](/typescript) SDK in your React app.

- If there is a connected wallet, the SDK is instantiated from the connected wallet&rsquo;s [signer](/react/react.usesigner). Meaning all
  transactions are initiated from the connected wallet.
- If there is no connected wallet, the SDK is in read-only mode on the [`activeChain`](http://localhost:3000/react/react.thirdwebprovider#activechain-recommended).

```jsx
import { useSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const sdk = useSDK();

  // Now you use all of the TypeScript SDK functionality
  // For example, deploy a new contract from the connected wallet.
  async function deployContract() {
    sdk?.deployer.deployNFTDrop({
      name: "My NFT Drop",
      primary_sale_recipient: "{{wallet_address}}",
    });
  }
}
```
