Hook for getting all listings (including expired ones) from a marketplace contract.

Available to use on contracts that implement the
[Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace) interface.

:::info Marketplace V3
Note: this hook is only available for [Marketplace](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Marketplace) contracts.

If you are using [Marketplace V3](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/MarketplaceV3),
use [useListingsV3](/react/react.useListingsV3) instead.

:::

```jsx
import { useListings } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Usage

Provide your marketplace contract and the filter you wish to use as the arguments.

```jsx
import { useContract, useListings } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useListings(contract);
}
```

## Configuration

### filter

```jsx
import { useContract, useListings } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const contractAddress = "{{contract_address}}";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress, "marketplace");
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useListings(
    contract,
    // highlight-start
    {
      count: 100, // number of listings to fetch
      offeror: "{{offeror_address}}", // only show listings with offers from this address
      seller: "{{seller_address}}", // only show listings where this address is the seller
      start: 0, // start at this listing index (pagination)
      tokenContract: "{{token_contract_address}}", // only show listings from this collection
      tokenId: "{{token_id}}", // only show listings for this token
    },
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```

## Return Value

The hook's `data` property, once loaded, is an array of listing objects.

The exact shape of the object depends on the type of listing.

For auctions, it will be a
`AuctionListing` object.
For direct listings, it will be a `DirectListing` object.

```ts
(AuctionListing | DirectListing)[] | undefined;
```

You can use the shared `type` property to determine which type of listing is being returned.

```ts
interface AuctionListing {
  /**

   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * The address of the asset being listed.
