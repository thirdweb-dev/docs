## Web3Button variable

> This feature is currently in beta and may change based on feedback that we receive.
> 

A component that allows the user to call an on-chain function on a contract.

The button has to be wrapped in a `ThirdwebProvider` in order to function.

## Example


```javascript
import { Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const App = () => {
 return (
  <div>
    <Web3Button contractAddress="0x..." action={(contract) => contract.erc721.transfer("0x...", 1)} />
  </div>
)
}
```

**Signature:**

```typescript
Web3Button: <TAction extends ActionFn>({ contractAddress, onSuccess, onError, onSubmit, isDisabled, contractAbi, children, action, className, ...themeProps }: PropsWithChildren<Web3ButtonProps<TAction>>) => JSX.Element
```
