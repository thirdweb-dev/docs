## useNetworkMismatch() function

Hook for checking whether the connected wallet is on the correct network specified by the `desiredChainId` passed to the `<ThirdwebProvider />`.

```

## Example

You can check if a users wallet is connected to the correct chain ID as follows:

```javascript

  const isMismatched = useNetworkMismatch()

  return <div>{isMismatched}</div>
}
```
From here, you can prompt users to switch their network using the `useNetwork` hook.

```
