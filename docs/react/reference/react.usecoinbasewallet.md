# useCoinbaseWallet

Hook for connecting to a Coinbase wallet.

```javascript
import { useCoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
```

## Example

We can allow users to connect with Coinbase Wallet as follows:

```javascript
import { useCoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const App = () => {
  const connectWithCoinbaseWallet = useCoinbaseWallet();

  return (
    <button onClick={connectWithCoinbaseWallet}>Connect Coinbase Wallet</button>
  );
};
```

Upon clicking this button, users will be prompted with a popup asking them scan a QR code with their Coinbase Wallet. Once they scan the QR code, their wallet will then be connected to the page as expected.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare function useCoinbaseWallet(): () => Promise<{
  data?: import("wagmi").ConnectorData<any> | undefined;
  error?: Error | undefined;
}>;
```

**Returns:**

() =&gt; Promise&lt;{ data?: import("wagmi").ConnectorData&lt;any&gt; \| undefined; error?: Error \| undefined; }&gt;
