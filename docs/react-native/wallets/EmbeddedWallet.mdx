import { CustomizeWalletConfiguratorRN } from "@components/build-wallet/CustomizeWalletConfiguratorRN";

A wallet configurator for [Embedded Wallet](/wallet/embedded-wallet) (email or Socials Sign In) which allows integrating the wallet with React Native.

```tsx
import { embeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

const embeddedWalletConfig = embeddedWallet();
```

<CustomizeWalletConfiguratorRN
  config="embeddedWalletConfig"
  configurator="embeddedWallet"
  connectUI="embeddedWalletConnectUI"
  selectUI="embeddedWalletSelectUI"
/>

<details>
  <summary>authentication options (optional)</summary>
  <div>

Whether to show the Sign In with different providers.

To use this feature you will need to enable the `Embedded Wallets` service for your `clientId`
in your [Dashboard Settings](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings) and you will need to allowlist
your app's `redirectUrl` (more on this below).

`redirectUrl`: The `redirectUrl` must be a deeplink your app supports. This
is going to be used to redirect back from the browser when using socials sign in options (Google, Apple, etc).

We wrote [a short guide](/react-native/faq/deeplinks) to help you enable deep links support in your mobile app.

```ts
embeddedWallet({
  // highlight-start
  auth: {
    options: ["email", "google", "apple", "facebook"],
    redirectUrl: "deep-link-to-your-app://",
  },
  // highlight-end
});
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>walletConnectReceiver</summary>
  <div>

Enables the wallet to be available to listen for WalletConnect events.

Note that to fully support this there needs to be a UI component to handle WalletConnect uris (`wc://`) and pass it to the wallet.

Defaults to `undefined`.

```
export type WalletConnectReceiverConfig = {
  walletConnectReceiver?:
    | {
        walletConnectWalletMetadata?: WCMetadata;
        walletConnectV2ProjectId?: string;
        walletConnectV2RelayUrl?: string;
      }
    | true;
};
```

<details>
  <summary>walletConnectV2ProjectId</summary>
  <div>

The WalletConnect V2 `projectId`. You can get one in the [WalletConnect portal](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in).

Defaults to a common `projectId` set by thirdweb. This should be ok for testing but note that if you want to deploy your mobile app it may make sense to create your own as WalletConnect may throttle traffic coming from the same `projectId`.

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>walletConnectV2RelayUrl</summary>
  <div>

Define a custom Relay Server URL. Defaults to "wss://relay.walletconnect.com"

</div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>walletConnectWalletMetadata</summary>
  <div>

Metadata that will be displayed in the dApp once your SmartWallet is connected to it.

```json
{
  name: string; // defaults to: "Thirdweb Smart Wallet",
  description: string; // defaults to: "Thirdweb Smart Wallet",
  url: string: // defaults to: "https://thirdweb.com",
  icons: string[]; // defaults to: ["https://thirdweb.com/favicon.ico"],
};
```

## Installation

To use the `embeddedWallet` you need to add the following dependencies to your project. Find the
command to add them all for convenience below.

yarn:

```yarn
yarn add amazon-cognito-identity-js@6.3.3 react-native-quick-base64 react-native-quick-crypto react-native-aes-gcm-crypto @react-native-community/netinfo react-native-inappbrowser-reborn@3.7.0
```

npm:

```npm
npm install amazon-cognito-identity-js@6.3.3 react-native-quick-base64 react-native-quick-crypto react-native-aes-gcm-crypto @react-native-community/netinfo react-native-inappbrowser-reborn@3.7.0
```

Here are the dependencies added:

- amazon-cognito-identity-js: "^6.3.3"
- react-native-quick-base64
- react-native-quick-crypto
- react-native-aes-gcm-crypto
  - This package requires minSdkVersion = 26 on Android
- @react-native-community/netinfo
- react-native-inappbrowser-reborn: "^3.7.0" (for Socials Sign In)

  - There's an open issue on RN > 0.72: https://github.com/margelo/react-native-quick-crypto/issues/186 which you can [fix by](https://github.com/margelo/react-native-quick-crypto/issues/186#issuecomment-1663666739) adding the following to your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

    ```
    packagingOptions {
        pickFirst 'lib/x86/libcrypto.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/x86_64/libcrypto.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/armeabi-v7a/libcrypto.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/arm64-v8a/libcrypto.so'
    }
    ```

  - When building the iOS app in release mode for RN 0.71 you need to enable the OpenSSL framework in XCode. There are several solutions for this here:

## Usage with `ConnectWallet`

To allow users to connect to this wallet using the [ConnectWallet](/react-native/react-native.connectwallet) component, you can add it to [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) prop.

```tsx
<ThirdwebProvider
  clientId="your-client-id"
  supportedWallets={[embeddedWallet()]}
>
  <YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

## Usage with `useEmbeddedWallet`

You can use the `useEmbeddedWallet` hook to programmatically connect to the wallet without using the [ConnectWallet](/react/react.connectwallet) component.

The wallet also needs to be added in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) if you want the wallet to auto-connect on next page load.

The hook will return all the necessary functions you'll need to authenticate and connect to the embedded wallet.

**Connecting with Google sign in:**

Note that if you want to sign in with Facebook or Apple you'll need pass "apple" or "facebook" to the `strategy` parameter.

```tsx
function App() {
  const { connect } = useEmbeddedWallet();

  const handleConnect = async () => {
    await connect({
      strategy: "google",
      redirectUrl: "deep-link-to-your-app://",
    });
  };

  return <View> ... </View>;
}
```

**Connecting with email verification:**

```tsx
function App() {
  const { connect, sendVerificationEmail } = useEmbeddedWallet();

  const preLogin = async (email: string) => {
    // send email verification code
    await sendVerificationEmail({ email });
  };

  const handleLogin = async (email: string, verificationCode: string) => {
    // verify email and connect
    await connect({
      strategy: "email_verification",
      email,
      verificationCode,
    });
  };

  return <View> ... </View>;
}
```

### Available connection strategies

```ts
// email verification
type EmailVerificationAuthParams = {
  strategy: "email_verification";
  email: string;
  verificationCode: string;
  recoveryCode?: string;
};

type SocialAuthParams = {
  strategy: "google" | "apple" | "facebook";
  redirectUrl: string;
};

// bring your own authentication
type JwtAuthParams = {
  strategy: "jwt";
  jwt: string;
  encryptionKey?: string;
};
```

<details>
  <summary>chainId (optional)</summary>
<div>

If `chainId` is provided, wallet will be connected to network with given `chainId`, else wallet will be connected to the `activeChain` by default.
