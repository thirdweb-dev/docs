# Choosing the Right Pre-Built Contract

Picking the contract that best suits your project can be made with a few key decisions:

1. What kind of project am I building? (NFTs, ERC20 tokens, a marketplace, etc.)
2. In what way do I want to release my project? (To be claimed by others, or just minted to me?)

## Which Contract Should I Use?

Below is a quiz that will help you decide which contract to use!
