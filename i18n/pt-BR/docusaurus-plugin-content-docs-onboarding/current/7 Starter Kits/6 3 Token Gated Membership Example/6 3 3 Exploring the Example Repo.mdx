# Exploring the Example Repo

In this section, we'll explain the key elements of the example repository.

We'll explore how we use the SDK to:

- Connect the user's wallet to the site using [MetaMask](/react/react.usemetamask)
- Verify the user owns the wallet by asking them to sign a message using [Auth](/auth)
- Check if the user has an NFT from our smart contract
- Allow them to [claim](/react/react.useclaimnft) a new NFT from our smart contract

## Restricting Access to the Homepage

When the user tries to visit the homepage `/`, we check on the server-side to see if they are authenticated:

```jsx title="index.js"
// This gets called on every request
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const user = await getUser(context.req);

  if (!user) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: "/login",
        permanent: false,
      },
    };
  }

  // ...
}
```

If they don't, we redirect them to the login page.

However, if they are authenticated, we then also check to see if they hold an NFT from our collection, and redirect them
to the login page if they don't.

```jsx title="index.js"
const hasNft = await checkBalance(sdk, address);

// If they don't have an NFT, redirect them to the login page
if (!hasNft) {
  return {
    redirect: {
      destination: "/login",
      permanent: false,
    },
  };
}
```

Here, the `checkBalance` function is a helper function that we use to check if the user has an NFT from our collection.

```jsx title="checkBalance.js"
import { contractAddress } from "../const/yourDetails";

export default async function checkBalance(sdk, address) {
  const editionDrop = sdk.getEditionDrop(
    contractAddress, // replace this with your contract address
  );

  // Here, "0" is checking the balance of token ID 0.
  const balance = await editionDrop.balanceOf(address, 0);

  // gt = greater than
  return balance.gt(0);
}
```

## The Login Page

On the `/login` route, we have a button that users can press to call the `login` function that we import from the React SDK:

```jsx title="login.js"
const login = useLogin();

// ...

{
  address ? (
    <>
      <button onClick={signIn}>Sign In</button>
    </>
  ) : (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => connectWithMetamask()}>Connect Wallet</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Inside the [\_app.jsx](./page/_app.jsx) file, we configured the redirect users to the `/` route after they successfully sign in:

```jsx
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      desiredChainId={activeChainId}
      authConfig={{
        domain: domainName,
        authUrl: "/api/auth",
        loginRedirect: "/", // redirect users to the home page after they successfully sign in
      }}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

Inside the [\_app.jsx](./page/_app.jsx) file, we configured the redirect users to the `/` route after they successfully sign in, meaning
once the user has authenticated (signed the message), they are redirected to the home page `/`,
and the `getServersideProps` logic runs again; checking to see if they have an NFT balance greater than `0`.

```jsx title="index.js"
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      desiredChainId={activeChainId}
      authConfig={{
        domain: domainName,
        authUrl: "/api/auth",
        loginRedirect: "/", // redirect users to the home page after they successfully sign in
      }}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

Finally, on the home page, we have a `Sign Out` button for the user, which calls the `logout`
function that we imported from the Auth SDK, and sends the user back to the `/login` route.

```jsx
const logout = useLogout();

// ...

<button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>;
```
