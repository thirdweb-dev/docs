## Intro

In this guide, we'll create our own **NFT Drop** with the TypeScript SDK! First we will create an **NFT Drop** on the dashboard, then create NFTs, and finally set claim conditions from the SDK. In these drop conditions, you can set the mint price, upload allowlists for claiming, and more!

We also need to connect a wallet. So if you don't have a wallet, make sure to sign up with **MetaMask** or **CoinWallet**. If don't have a wallet, [you can follow this guide to create one](/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet). 

## Dashboard setup

The first thing we need to do is head over to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) and create an **NFT Drop** contract. if you don't know how to do this, check out [this guide](/learn/introduction).

Once the contract is created, it's time to create our first NFT, but we don't need the dashboard for that! I mean we could, but why use GUI if we can use TypeScript!?

## The code

### 1. Create a TypeScript file

Go ahead and create a new TypeScript file. Let's call it `index.ts` and open it in your favorite code editor. We'll use VS code.

![](/assets/portal/guides/create-a-drop-with-typescript-sdk/terminal.png)

Next up use we'll install the ThirdWeb SDK using npm!

### 2. SDK installation and setup with TypeScript

- **@thirdweb-dev/sdk** - thirdweb TypeScript SDK.
- **ethers** - will give us very useful utils.
- **dotenv** - to hide our private key.
- **typescript** - since this is a TypeScript project
- **@types/node** - typing for node as a dev dependency.
- **tslib** - utility package

```bash
npm init -y
npm install @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers dotenv 
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node ts-node tslib
```

### 3. Import the SDK

Let's take the code step by step. At the end we'll include a full code snippet.

Import the following classes from the sdk.

In order to make use of our SDK, you need to establish a connection to a blockchain.
Click [here](/learn-thirdweb/connect-to-blockchain) to learn how to connect to the blockchain and instantiate our SDK.

For this guide, you will need to instantiate the SDK following [these](/learn-thirdweb/connect-to-blockchain#using-your-own-signer-with-thirdweb) steps, using your own signer with thirdweb.

### 4. Define which contract to use

Now we need to define which contract we want to use. Here we created an NFT Drop contract and called it '**My Drop**'. This contract has an address. We need to pass the address here. You can find the address on the dashboard under **My Drop**:

![See NFT Drop contract address under contract name](/assets/portal/guides/create-a-drop-with-typescript-sdk/nft-drop-contract-dashboard-view.png)

In our `index.ts` file we include the following code. First we define a variable `nftDrop` and store our contract in here.

Then we create an object that uses the drop contract inside the SDK with our address.

```tsx:index.ts
// Initialize drop contract by passing in contract address
const nftDrop = sdk.getNftDrop("0x727609B45c74e6a2c9EA2B82b3fa5BA7c63dBc37");
```

### 5. Create the NFT in our Drop contract!

The arguments passed over here are the same as minting an NFT inside the dashboard. If you want to familiarize yourself with the process, check out the dashboard!

```tsx:index.ts
// Minting the NFT asynchronously
const lazyMintNft = async () => {
  try {
    await nftDrop.createBatch([{
      name: "thirdweb",
      description: "Smart contracts you control. Tools that accelerate your workflow. Intuitive SDKs and widgets for developers.",
      image: "ipfs://<YOUR_IPFS_FOLDER_CID>/1.png",
      attributes: {},
    }]);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
};

// Running the entire thing
lazyMintNft();
```


### 6. Set up claim phases

Once your **NFT Drop** contract is created and has some NFTs, it's time to set the **Claim Phases**. These phases are some of the rules we'll apply when someone wants to claim an NFT, such as price, max amount of tokens claimed, wallets allowed to claim, etc. 

Below we will set two claim phases - you can set more or less depending on your needs. 

The first claim phase will be a presale with an added snapshot. Only the addresses listed will be able to claim NFTs from the drop. 
We are also adding `maxQuantity` so only 20 NFTs can be minted in this phase.

The second phase does not add a snapshot so everyone is able to claim. 

```tsx:index.ts
const presaleStartTime = new Date();
const publicSaleStartTime = new Date(new Date() + 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000); // today's date + 24 hours
const allowList = ['0x...', '0x...'] // modify this with your allow list
const claimConditions = [
  {
    startTime: presaleStartTime, // start the presale now
    maxQuantity: 20, // limit how many mints for this presale
    price: 0.01, // presale price
    snapshot: allowList, // limit minting to only certain wallet addresses
  },
  {
    startTime: publicSaleStartTime, // 24h after presale, start public sale
    price: 0.08, // public sale price
  }
]);
const setClaimConditions = async () => {
  try {
    await nftDrop.claimConditions.set(claimConditions);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
  }
}
setClaimConditions();
```

So the only thing left is to run our code! Open a terminal and paste the following:

```bash:virtual-env
# Runs the TypeScript file
npx ts-node index.ts
```

### 7. That's it!

Congratulations! You have created your own drop. The NFTs are available to be claimed! You can use the code below to check all your drops!

```tsx:index.ts
// Get all unclaimed NFTs
const getAllNfts = () => {
  try {
    await nftDrop.getAllUnclaimed();
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
  }
}
getAllNfts();
```
