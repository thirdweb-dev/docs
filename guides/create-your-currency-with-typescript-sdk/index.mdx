## Intro

This guide explains how to create your own currency. We will create a **Token** contract on the dashboard and mint some tokens from the SDK. We also need to connect a wallet. So if you don't have a wallet, make sure to sign up with **MetaMask** or **CoinWallet**. If don't have a wallet, [you can follow this guide to create one](/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet).

## Dashboard setup

The first thing we need to do is head over to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) and create a **Token** contract. if you don't know how to do this, check out [this guide](/learn/introduction).

Once your **Token** contract has been created, it's time to mint our own currency, but we don't need the dashboard for that! For use cases where the interaction has a high frequency and requires conditions, using the SDK is more efficient.

## The code

### 1. Install the SDK

Next up use we'll install the ThirdWeb SDK using npm!

SDK installation and setup with TypeScript

- **@thirdweb-dev/sdk** - thirdweb TypeScript SDK.
- **ethers** - will give us very useful utils.
- **dotenv** - to hide our private key.
- **typescript** - since this is a TypeScript project
- **@types/node** - typing for node as a dev dependency.
- **tslib** - utility package

```bash
npm init -y
npm install @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers dotenv 
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node ts-node tslib
```

### 2. Import the SDK

Let's take the code step by step.

Create a file called `currency.ts`

![](/assets/portal/guides/create-your-currency-with-typescript-sdk/18_ts_file.png)

In order to make use of our SDK, you need to establish a connection to a blockchain.
Click [here](/learn-thirdweb/connect-to-blockchain) to learn how to connect to the blockchain and instantiate our SDK.

For this guide, you will need to instantiate the SDK following [these](/learn-thirdweb/connect-to-blockchain#using-your-own-signer-with-thirdweb) steps, using your own signer with thirdweb.

### 3. Define which contract to use

Now we need to define which contract we want to use. Here we created a Token contract and called it '**Future Coin**'. This contract has an address. We need to pass the address here. You can find the address on the dashboard under '**Future Coin**':

![See Token contract address under contract name](/assets/portal/guides/create-your-currency-with-typescript-sdk/token-contract-dashboard-view.png)

In our `currency.ts` we include the following code.

The token variable uses the token contract inside the sdk with our address for the token smart contract.

```tsx:currency.ts
// Instantiate Token contract
const token = sdk.getToken("0x43E0C32F2BC4A79e70421CF449e14EcADD3adbad");
```

### 4. Time to mint the coins (tokens)!

The arguments passed over here are the same as minting the tokens inside the dashboard. If you want to familiarize yourself with the process, check out the dashboard!

```tsx:currency.ts
const mintCurrency = async (amount) => {
  try {
    await token.mint(amount);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}

// Set the amount of currency you want to mint
const amount = "1000";
// Execute the function
mintCurrency(amount);
```

So the only thing left is to run our code! Open a terminal and paste the following:

```bash
# Runs the TypeScript file
npx ts-node index.ts
```

### 5. Results

Get the balance to check it out or head over to the dashboard.

## That's it!

Congratulations! You have now created your own currency using only TypeScript code! The next step is spending it!
