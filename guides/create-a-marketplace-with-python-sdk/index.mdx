# Create your own NFT marketplace with Python

In this guide, we'll create a marketplace smart contract using Python!

<!-- truncate -->

## Intro

In a marketplace, users can list NFTs for sale. [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) is an example of a marketplace.

The first thing we need to do is head over to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) and deploy a new **Marketplace** contract.

- Click **Deploy New contract**
- Click Deploy Now on the **Marketplace** contract
- Configure your metadata, and deploy the contract to the Mumbai (MATIC) test network.

## Creating listings

You can easily create listings on your marketplace using the dashboard.

But in this guide, we'll create them using Python!

Go ahead and create a new Python file. Let's call it `marketplace.py`, and open it in your favorite code editor.

Use the following command in your terminal to install the thirdweb SDK in the project!

```bash
pip install thirdweb-sdk
```

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

Now we can import the SDK, along with the other libraries we're going to use.

```python title="marketplace.py"
from thirdweb import ThirdwebSDK
from thirdweb.types import NewDirectListing
```

To sign transactions from your wallet, you need to instantiate the SDK with your wallet's private key.

:::info How to export your private key

Learn how to [export your private key](/guides/create-a-metamask-wallet#export-your-private-key) from your wallet.

:::

:::warning

Ensure you store and access your private key securely.

- **Never** commit any file that may contain your private key to your source control.

[Learn more about securely accessing your private key](/web3-sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-key).

:::

Now we can initialize our SDK:

```python
# Load environment variables into this file
load_dotenv()

# Learn more about securely accessing your private key: https://portal.thirdweb.com/web3-sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-key
PRIVATE_KEY = "<your-private-key-here>"

# Set the network you want to operate on, or add your own RPC URL here
NETWORK = "mumbai"

# Finally, you can create a new instance of the SDK to use
sdk = ThirdwebSDK.from_private_key(PRIVATE_KEY, NETWORK)
```

## Creating Listings

Firstly, let's connect to the marketplace contract we just created.

```python
MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x..." # Replace with your contract address
marketplace = sdk.get_marketplace(MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS)
```

Then use the `marketplace` to create a new listing!

Here, we define the `asset_contract_address` and `token_id`, which identify an NFT that we want to list for sale.

If you don't have any NFTs to list, check out our guide "[Mint an NFT Collection with Python](/guides/mint-nft-collection-with-python-sdk)" to mint some!

```python
marketplace.direct.create_listing(NewDirectListing(
    asset_contract_address= '<your-nft-contract-address-here>', # Replace with your NFT Collection contract address
    token_id= 0, # change this to the token ID of the NFT you want to list
    start_time_in_seconds= 30000000000,
    listing_duration_in_seconds= 10000,
    quantity= 1,
    currency_contract_address= '0x9c3C9283D3e44854697Cd22D3Faa240Cfb032889', # This is the Wrapped Matic contract address
    buyout_price_per_token= 1
))
```

So the only thing left is to run our code!

Open a terminal and run your `marketplace.py` file.

```bash
python3 marketplace.py
```

## That's it!

Now you have your own marketplace built with the Python SDK.

Learn what else you can do with the SDK on our [Python Marketplace documentation](https://portal.thirdweb.com/python/marketplace).
